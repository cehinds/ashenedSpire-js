# Offline download and save-transfer verification

## Branch selection, progress and save location: 0.6.0.119

- Added data-configured Release, Test, Dev and Main feed choices, with branch
  and version in downloaded filenames. All four live metadata feeds responded.
- Download invokes the native save picker during the initiating click when
  available, streams bytes to the selected file, and closes only after validation.
  Unsupported browsers receive an automatic Blob download with a retry button.
- Progress shows percentage and received/total MB when size is known, otherwise
  an indeterminate bar and received MB. Build selection is locked during transfer.
- All 10 targeted Node tests and 14 browser controls checks passed: four branches,
  partial progress, activation timing, cancellation, disk failure/abort, exact
  fallback Blob bytes, automatic browser download request, and no exceptions.
- Browser controls checks use a throttled 1 MB fixture and controlled writable
  handle. They do not exercise the native Windows dialog or prove a completed
  on-disk download. The normal browser save still canceled with C: full.
- Build-version (8), shipped-file (6), and whitespace checks passed. Full Node
  suite results below are from 0.6.0.116, not this build.

## Download button regression: 0.6.0.117

- Fixed legacy release metadata without a byte count disabling Download.
- Opening the panel now checks the release automatically.
- All 6 targeted Node tests and 3 live-release browser checks passed. The real
  published 0.6.0.81 HTML was fetched and prepared (93.4 MB), with no browser
  exceptions. The final file save was not tested; the system drive remains full.
- Build-version (8), shipped-file (6), and About/changelog (279) checks passed.
  The full Node suite below ran on 0.6.0.116, not 0.6.0.117.

## Previous full validation

Build: **0.6.0.116**, rebased onto dev `bdc1374f` (including the armament kits).

- Final standalone browser checks: **8 passed**, using the generated file with
  networking disabled and a real run fixture. Import cancellation, successful
  import, recovery backup, reload, map resume, combat entry, and blocked-storage
  refusal were exercised. No browser exceptions were recorded.
- Build version: 8 checks passed. Shipped aliases: 6 checks passed. About/changelog:
  279 checks passed. Receipt and whitespace checks passed.
- Pages metadata selftest passed both deliberate breakages. Its release metadata
  comes from the exact artifact rather than manually maintained sizes or links.
- The final combined-tree Node suite passed **138/0** (exit 0), including the
  additional 704 armament class/loadout regression cases. The earlier pre-catch-up
  full suite also passed 138/0.

## Download-test limitation

The complete download/export/import browser journey passed on build 0.6.0.111,
including byte-for-byte comparison of the downloaded HTML. Later runs fetched the
game successfully, but Edge canceled the large file save with zero bytes written.
The system drive was full during these runs. The small JSON export still saved.
The final build uses an explicit Save game file click after preparation; its
large-file save has **not** passed the final browser check. The PR remains draft.

The release feed in the download test is a local fixture. No release or Pages
deployment was performed. Phone-width captures are browser emulation, not a
physical-phone installation test. The final offline-only check skips download
and uses the generated HTML directly.
