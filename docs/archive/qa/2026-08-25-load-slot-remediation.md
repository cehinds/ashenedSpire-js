> Archived 2026-09-27 (docs audit): a dated QA record from build 0.4.0 (August 2026); it describes that build, not the current one. The current QA process is [docs/QA-TESTING.md](../../QA-TESTING.md).

# Load-slot selection and review remediation — item #1

## Status and authority

- Owner: AshenSpire App Team 1.
- Routing override: Constantine assigned this 27-item remediation queue directly
  to App Team 1 instead of the normal IT Support intake.
- Scope: item #1 only. Item #2 and every later item remain gated on Main's
  confirmation that the previous item was approved and integrated.
- Lane: `C:\repos\AshenSpire-qa-01-load-slot`, branch
  `codex/qa-01-load-slot`, based on
  `origin/dev@75061e3ae78d8ca52df414b12d7548157ce0cf0f`.
- Delivery state: local candidate only. No push, PR, merge, project-board
  mutation, hosted deployment, release promotion, tag, or publication.

## Returned accessibility repair

QA Team 2 withheld the candidate at
`1877443319ebd70289aad8044a1d6d08f7533952`: at 390x844 the modal Close
rendered 27x27 and occupied-slot Delete rendered 44x27; at 1200x730 Close
rendered 30x30. The required floor is 44x44 for every interactive target.

The bounded repair applies `min-width` and `min-height` from the shared
`--tap-floor` token to `title-modal-close-control` and
`title-save-slot-delete`. The focused browser gate reads both rendered
rectangles at 390x844 and 1200x730, and its same-door corpus contains one plant
for each regression. After QA Team 1 released the browser lane, both controls
rendered at exactly 44x44 in the phone and desktop probes. The shipped aliases
were then regenerated once from the settled source and the exact-build
screenshots were refreshed.

## Observed player problem

An occupied Load Game slot could look selected while Continue was disabled.
The visible single-select state and the command state disagreed, so the player
could not tell whether activating the highlighted save would select it, deselect
it, or load it.

## Player contract

```text
Open Load Game
    |
    v
occupied slot visibly selected + Continue enabled
    |
    +-- first activation ------> selection/focus preserved
    |
    +-- second activation -----> themed review
    |                              |-- Back/Escape -> same selected slot
    |                              `-- Load Save --> selected run
    |
    `-- 600 ms pointer/touch hold ----------------> selected run
```

- A selected occupied slot and enabled Continue now derive from the same slot.
- First activation is idempotent and leaves selection, focus, and Continue intact.
- Second activation opens a themed review with neutral **Back to Saves** and
  green **Load Save** actions.
- Back and Escape return to the Load list with the same slot selected and focused.
- A stationary 600 ms pointer/touch hold loads directly. The slot exposes
  **HOLD** plus explicit tooltip and accessible help.
- Keyboard and controller activation use the same deterministic first/second
  activation state; neither depends on browser double-click timing or inherits
  the timed pointer shortcut.

## Stable components and owners

Changed catalog components:

- `title-menu-modal`
- `title-save-slot`
- `title-modal-close-control`
- `title-save-slot-delete`
- `title-modal-actions`
- `title-modal-back-control`
- `title-modal-continue-control`

The controller remains `title.mountTitle`; the shared pointer/touch gesture is
`holdconfirm.armHold`; the duration is authored at
`balance.ui.titleLoadHold.ms` and validated by `validateContent`.

## Exact artifact

- Build: `0.4.0.1366`
- Source digest: `5063bac9f8`
- Generated aliases: `AshenSpire.html`, `build/AshenSpire.html`,
  `dist/AshenSpire.html`, and the local stamped alias are byte-identical.
- SHA-256: `174fac321820295d670a18702c890d915083a7203350f2c80e4a8a7a081a182e`
- Local source preview: <http://localhost:8582/?shot=title>

## Behavior and visual evidence

- Full focused browser gate: 62/62 at the exact displayed build/source stamp.
- Compact browser gate: 53/53.
- Same-door known-bad corpus: 25/25 plants caught; clean copied tree green.
- Covered state transitions: initial selection/Continue agreement; idempotent
  first activation; pointer, keyboard, and production-poller controller second
  activation; Back; Escape; review commit; direct mobile touch hold; help copy;
  responsive startup/title shapes; zero unavailable/UNKNOWN result.

Exact-build visual captures were refreshed after the single serialized rebuild
and reviewed at original resolution:

The phone list shows the selected occupied slot, enabled Continue, visible HOLD
instruction, explicit help, and the 44x44 Delete target. Both review captures
show the 44x44 Close target plus unclipped neutral Back to Saves and green Load
Save actions.

## Verification receipt

- `node tests/run-node.mjs`: 110 passed, 0 failed after the exact build.
- `node tools/testnumbers.mjs --raw`: 108 labels, no duplicates.
- `node tools/content-build.mjs --check`: generated content current.
- `node tools/ui-components.mjs`: 19/19 contracts.
- `node tools/ui-components.mjs --selftest`: 19/19 plants observed red.
- `node tools/linkcheck.mjs`: 355/355 module graphs link.
- `node tools/verify-shipped.mjs`: 6/6 checks.
- `node tools/verify-shipped.mjs --selftest`: 25/25 known-bad/control checks.
- `git diff --check`: required in final commit receipt.

## Remaining boundaries

- The browser controller evidence uses a standard-mapping gamepad shim read by
  the production poller; a physical controller was not used.
- Real-device Safari was not run.
- QA Team 1 independently passed the pre-repair frozen candidate's functional
  browser flow and released the browser lane. Independent review of this exact
  tap-target repair head remains separate from this maker receipt and must be
  coordinated through Main before integration approval.
- Release readiness remains RED and Constantine-only.
