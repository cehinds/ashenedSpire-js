# AshenSpire — Cast, enemies, and consequences

Companion to [LORE.md](LORE.md). The bible says what the world is; this says who
is in it and what the Burning did to everything else. Every name here already
exists in content (`src/content/events.js`, `src/content/enemies/*`, `docs/ENEMY-ROSTER.md`)
or in the seat plan, so nothing below needs a new id to start being written.

Rule from the bible, restated: none of this is stated in one place in the game.
It is the authors' knowledge, assembled by the player from lines.

## 1. The four who climb

**What all four share** (LORE §4): the seasons stopped and the outside is dying
of it; the loose Ember has begun to read the unwritten and is drifting toward
the one hearth built to burn them; only the unmarked can walk the ring and stand
in the Spire; and each of them has one marked name on the ring, half-read, that
relighting a hearth will finish. The night before the run, a Forsaken burned in
their hamlet. That is the push. Below is what each of them brings to it.

Each entry: what they want, what is wrong with them, what they say they want,
what they are actually walking into, and the thing about them that does not add
up. The contradiction is the character.

### The Reaver — blood and steel

- **Wants** to be paid for a job that ended. Hired by the Bastion to hold the Fell
  Courtyard gate; the gate fell, the coin was already spent, and nobody ever
  said "you can go."
- **Flaw:** cannot leave a post. Takes every fight as the gate again. Bleeds
  things because a bleeding thing is still a thing you can hold a line against.
- **Stated goal:** relight the Field Flame. "That's the contract."
- **Actual conflict:** the Fell Warden is the man who hired them, still holding the
  same gate from the other side. Killing him ends the contract. The Reaver has
  never wanted the contract to end.
- **Their name:** the Fell Warden, who hired them. Finishing his reading ends
  the contract and the man in the same stroke.
- **Contradiction:** the only climber who was never marked and never promised,
  and the one who behaves most like something sworn.

### The Rogue — ash and opportunism

- **Wants** one Court Surgeon: the one who stitched their family back to their
  posts when the Court Flame died. Wants to ask one question and not wait for
  the answer.
- **Flaw:** believes in nothing so that nothing can be taken. Poisons rather
  than fights; leaves rather than loses. Has never finished a conversation.
- **Stated goal:** cinders. "Everything sells."
- **Actual conflict:** the Stitched Court is full of people who did not get to
  leave. Every Marionette is somebody's family kept at a post. The Rogue's
  speed is a way of never standing still long enough to be one of them.
- **Their name:** a Marionette sewn to the Stitched Throne — the sister the
  surgeon kept at her post. The Thousand Hands are a thousand of these.
- **Contradiction:** the one who says the flames are nothing, and the one whose
  every move was learned inside the Court that the flame made.

### The Starseer — starstone

- **Wants** to know whether the Astronomer was right. Took his charts and left
  the Observatory before the eclipse. Owes him an answer they have not worked
  out yet.
- **Flaw:** rhythm over force; the second spell is the true one because the
  first is always a hedge. Fragile because they will not commit. Reads
  everything twice and acts once, late.
- **Stated goal:** reach the Spire and see the fourth hearth. "It's on the
  charts."
- **Actual conflict:** the Hollow Astronomer built the Spire, read what it
  burns, and now wants the Ember to leave the world rather than reach it. The
  Starseer carries the charts for the tower he built and the sky he wants it
  sent back to, and has not chosen.
- **Their name:** the Astronomer himself, marked crown-born, half-read, still
  standing in his observatory calling down the thing that is eating him.
- **Contradiction:** starstone remembers what it was before it was a hearth, and
  the Starseer is the only climber whose power is the same substance as the
  thing that burned the kingdom.

### The Herald — gold and rot

- **Wants** to know why the fire stopped on them. Marked at birth, a novice of
  the Furnace Chapel, and the one person in the three cities on whom the
  Burning began and did not finish.
- **Flaw:** feeds everything from themselves. Cannot ask. Would rather be spent
  than owed. Spreads the Blight on purpose because it is the only thing they
  are sure they carry.
- **Stated goal:** relight all three. The only climber who means it.
- **Actual conflict:** the Furnace Saint is their teacher, still feeding an
  empty hearth, and the Herald is the proof that the hearth can refuse a name.
  Beating him is beating the only person who ever told them what they were for.
- **Their name:** the Furnace Saint. Finishing his reading is the only way to
  learn what he knew about the Herald's, and he will not say it while he burns.
- **Contradiction:** the flames' last believer, and the one living argument
  that the flames' promise can be broken.

## 2. The companions

One at a time. Companions are owned by SPEC §14.3 (D17, owner decision 2026-09-27); the seat plan's §5 table is design input. Each is one voice from LORE §7 and one open
question from LORE §10.

| Companion | Seat | Voice | Wants | Opposes | Dies if |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **The Keeper of the Nameless** | none (met at the Grave) | the Forsaken | to finish walking; does not know where | any choice that writes a name into a hearth | never in a fight: the fire tried them first, could not finish, and will not try again. They *leave* if you feed a name — unless the name is theirs, given. |
| **Sergeant Ilse of the Fell Courtyard** (a Wandering Soldier who still knows) | weald | the Warden's field-book | to be finished reading | sparing the Fell Warden | the Bell Keeper's third peal, if asked into that fight |
| **Aurel, Court Surgeon** (the Rogue's one) | marches | the frozen docks | to unstitch what he stitched, one at a time | any Marionette left standing | the Stitched King's Thousand Hands |
| **Novice Wen** (the Herald's junior; marked, unburned, does not know why either) | reach | the Chapel liturgy | to reach the Spire and see the heresy | the Blight-Priest's offer | the Furnace Saint's Open Furnace |
| **Old Harrow, the merchant's cart-hand** | any (recruited at the cart) | the Forsaken | to stop carrying names | every sale to the merchant | nowhere; walks away at the next city if trust falls, and takes the cart's ledger |

The Keeper is the one companion every ending turns on: their name is the fuel
the Restore ending asks for first, the Transform ending tests with, and the one
thing a Claim ending can refuse to spend.

## 3. The quest givers

Quests are short and their objectives are on the map (seat plan §2b). Givers are
the existing event figures, given a seat and a want.

**Implementation boundary:** the first six quests below are planned chains,
not shipped objectives or promises of their stated consequences. The Second
Cairn and The Last Lantern are implemented event chains; their later steps
enter the random Unknown-node pool after the required earlier choices. They
are not pinned to a destination. The companion endings and boss parleys remain
future narrative plans.

| Giver | Where met | The quest | What it is really about |
|---|---|---|---|
| **The Wayward Pilgrim** | weald road, any seat's road as a wayfarer | *The Cracked Bell* (planned): reach the Bellfoundry and hear it ring once more | He is walking toward a sound. The bell is the Bell Keeper. Finishing the quest is fighting the boss with the Pilgrim present. |
| **The Wandering Physician** | road, then the city as the Physician site | *A Little Flesh* (planned): bring him a cinder from a thing that asked to die | He is testing whether cinders taken by mercy burn differently. They do not. He does not tell you. |
| **The Sleeping Smith** | weald or reach city, Smith site | *Sunderplate* (planned): bring him the Fell Warden Brand or the Ember Idol to reforge | He can only work a hearth-key. He wants to know if the flame's heat can be made into a tool again. Reforging a hearth-key means that seat's flame cannot be relit this run. |
| **The Merchant's Ghost** | marches road | *Half Price* (planned): find the merchant's cart and sell it the ghost's own cinder | The ghost is one of the three the merchant keeps warm. It wants out of the hearth. Selling it back is the only way to stop the private flame, and the merchant's stock changes for the rest of the run. |
| **The Blight-Priest** | reach road, Shrine of the Feral Ember | *The Reliquary* (planned): carry his reliquary to the Furnace Saint | The reliquary holds his own name, cut out. He wants it fed to a hearth by someone else's hand. |
| **The Oracle** | any city, Lorekeeper site | *The Riddle* (planned): answer three questions across three seats | She is the Astronomer's first apprentice. Her three answers are the three tellings; the fourth question is on the page in the Spire. |
| **The Keeper of the Nameless** | the Grave, then random road events | *The Second Cairn* (implemented): answer the first grave and the Keeper, then keep vigil, rest, loot, or leave at the second cairn | Accepting thanks opens the vigil (two random card upgrades); returning the stolen cinders opens rest (heal 30% max HP); standing against the Keeper’s followers opens looting (120 cinders and Guilt). Vigil and rest raise the fallen swords; looting leaves them fallen. Any of those three answers completes this event chain; leaving does not. The Keeper is absent, their route unknown. This is not the planned companion ending at the Spire. |
| **The Road Warden** | random road events | *The Last Lantern* (implemented): buy signal oil (40 cinders) or haul the beacon (8 damage), then meet the caravan | An unmarked keeper of routes for survivors, called Road Warden by the drivers; neither the Fell Warden nor a member of the marked Warden order. Oil opens a quartermaster's lesson (one random card upgrade); hauling opens wages (60 cinders). Either route permits stealing the medicine strongbox (100 cinders and Guilt). Those three answers complete the chain; leaving does not. The caravan supplies Lantern Haven and the cold hamlets. |
| **The Bell Keeper, the Stitched King, the Furnace Saint** | boss antechambers, as parleys | no quest: an offer | Each boss offers the player its hearth-key for the Keeper's name. Refusing is the fight. |

## 4. The enemies, and why some are not human

**No other realm.** Nothing in this world came from anywhere else, and the
question "are they from another realm" is one the player should ask and the
world should answer *no* to. Not one enemy, companion, quest giver or beast
walked in from somewhere outside. Everything that is wrong here is the
kingdom's own.

The single exception is not a character and never becomes one: the object the
caldera families caught. Whether it fell, when it fell, whether it was ever a
star, whether anything about it was alive when it arrived, and whether it is
the only one — none of that is answered, by anyone, ever
([LORE-EMBER.md](LORE-EMBER.md)). A Forsaken who decides the Ember came from
another realm is entitled to that opinion. So is one who decides the Chapel
built it out of eight hundred years of dead people. The game agrees with
neither.

The corrupted come in four kinds, and the kind says what the fire did to them:

| Kind | What it was | Why it looks like that | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| **The marked** | citizens, soldiers, knights, saints | human, with a cinder where the heart was; the fire read them from the inside and did not finish | Wandering Soldier, Gilded Knight, Ember-Starved Pilgrim, Eclipse Cantor, the Fell Warden, the Furnace Saint |
| **The stitched** | the marked, put back together by the Court's surgeons to keep their posts | joins, wire, too many hands; order kept past meaning | Court Surgeon, Stitched Hound, Court Marionette, Living Armor, the Stitched King, the Glass Regent, the Marrow Organist |
| **The herds and the wild** | livestock and beasts the kingdom **also marked** — the Field Flame's writ ran over every living thing in the weald, and a marked herd was a warm herd | Blight Hounds were kennel dogs; the Cinderbear was a marked bear in a Warden's den; Lantern Moths carry ember dust looking for the hearth they were bred beside; Handspiders and the Cinder Mantis are what the reach's mine-vermin became beside a caldera full of loose ember | Blight Hound, Briar Hermit (a Warden grafted to briar, half herd, half order), Lantern Moth, Handspider, Cinderbear, Cinder Mantis, Stitch Crab |
| **The unfinished** | names the fire read only partly | no body left, only the reading: a wisp is a name still being said; an Ash Revenant is the Crown Flame trying to remember a shape; a Valkyrie Shade is what the Chapel's last written soldiers look like from the inside | Grave Wisp, Ash Revenant, Valkyrie Shade, Charred Colossus (a whole company read at once, into one shape) |

Two things predate the kingdom and are not corrupted at all:

- **The Ashheart Dragon.** The wyrm the Cinder Reach was mined around. The
  Ember fell into its caldera; the kingdom mined the deep heat out from under a
  sleeping thing and consecrated Wyrm Aspirants to keep it asleep. It is old,
  it is native, and it is the only creature in the game with no cinder in it. It
  does not care what you came for.
- **The Thorn Matriarch's briar and the Goldbough Avatar's sapling.** Plants
  grow. The weald was always going to take the Bastion back; the flame only
  delayed it.

**The Hollow Astronomer's heavens** are not another realm either. "Falling
Heavens" and "Orbital Shards" are starstone: he has learned to call down what
the Ember is made of. The eclipse he watched was the Ember dimming, seen from
the one tower built to look at it.

**The Blighted Valkyrie** is the exception that proves it: the last name written
before the Burning, the one the light saved, and the one the Blight took
hardest. She is what a fully written, fully burned, still-standing citizen looks
like. Rot wings because the Chapel wrote its soldiers as winged. She is not from
anywhere. She is from here more than anyone.

## 5. Consequences: before the fall

The three flames did not only warm three cities. The kingdom exported its
warmth, and the world arranged itself around a fire it did not own.

- **Seasons were a service.** The Field Flame turned them on time, and turned
  them for whoever paid. The weald's harvest fed lands the map does not show;
  their winters were the kingdom's to lengthen. Neighbours who fell behind on
  tribute got a late spring. Nobody outside the walls called this a war.
- **The mark was a border.** Marked people could travel the ring and be warm
  anywhere; the unmarked could not enter a city after dusk. The Forsaken were
  not a people. They were everyone the border made: hamlet families, the
  marches' ice-fishers, the reach's mine camps, the coast's ship-breakers. A
  whole second kingdom lived in the cold between three warm ones and was never
  counted.
- **The Court sold promises.** A mark could be bought. In the last century the
  Court marked foreign nobles for a fee, so the fire's roll of promised names
  grew faster than any city's births. When the Burning called the promise in,
  it called it in *abroad* too. The neighbours' courts burned from the inside
  in the same night, and never knew why.
- **Ships stopped coming to the coast** twenty years before the end, when the
  Spire's draw began to pull the weather. Starwatch Terrace logged the tides
  going wrong. The Saints said heresy; the Astronomer said the tower was
  working. It was. It was drawing on the coast's ship-breakers, the nearest
  unwritten, and the tides were the least of what it pulled.
- **The dragon's sleep was the reach's economy.** Wyrm Aspirants were
  consecrated to keep it under; the Ember Mine ran on the deep heat it slept
  around. The mines made the cinders the Chapel burned. The kingdom was, in the
  end, mining a sleeping animal to feed a star.

## 6. Consequences: after the fall

- **The seasons stopped where they were.** The weald is stuck in a spring that
  will not turn, which is why it is too green (LORE §6). The marches are in the
  winter the Field Flame was lengthening for somebody's unpaid tribute, and the
  river froze the night the Court Flame died and has not thawed. The reach did
  not change; it was already burning. Outside the ring, the lands that bought
  their springs are in whatever season they were in the night the fire went
  out, and have been for a generation.
- **The sea came up the coast.** The Spire's draw held the tides off the lower
  city; unlit, it holds nothing, and the sea took the terraces to the second
  storey. The Drowned Coast is not a flood. It is a tower that stopped pulling.
- **The foreign marked burned too.** Every court that bought a mark lost its
  marked in one night. Some of those lands are why Ember-Starved Pilgrims exist:
  they walked in from outside, following the only light left, and found a road
  with no warm end.
- **The unmarked inherited the ring.** The Forsaken were the only people the
  fire could not touch, so they are the only people left who can walk it. The
  climb is not a quest for the chosen. It is the uncounted second kingdom
  finally going inside.
- **The dragon is waking.** The Aspirants who kept it asleep are corrupted and
  consecrate nothing now. The deep heat is rising through the caldera. Nobody
  on the road says this. The Ashheart Caldera's "Heart Rumble" says it.
- **The Ember is making a decision.** It flees relit hearths and drifts toward
  the one that owes it nothing. Whether that is escape or a homing is LORE §10's
  open question, and the Spire is where the world finds out.

## 7. What an author does with this

- A **wayfarer** is one line from §5 or §6, in the seat's voice.
- A **companion's opposes/dies-if** rows are the whole of their design; write
  their three lines from §2 and stop.
- A **quest** is the third column of §3; the fourth column is never said aloud.
- An **enemy line** answers "what were you" in one clause, from §4.
- Nothing in §5–6 is told as history. It is told as weather, tides, a late
  spring, a frozen river, a ship that never came.
