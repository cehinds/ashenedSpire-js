# Moving high-res art out of this repository — plan

Status: **steps 1–3 done, step 4 in progress** (see [Status](#status)). This is
step 5 of the LFS / art-tier work (2026-09-26). `art/` and `assets/` are still
tracked here; steps 5–7 each need their own owner go-ahead.

**Extended by [EXTERNAL-ASSETS-PLAN.md](./EXTERNAL-ASSETS-PLAN.md)** (owner, 2026-09-27: "all assets shouldn't be bundled but
should be like the art"). The light tier, the fonts, the music and the map
tiles move to the art repository too, and the game loads every asset at
runtime. The lines below marked *(superseded)* change as that plan says; its
*Supersedes* list names each one.

## Why

- The Git LFS budget ran out on built HTML. That part is fixed:
  - #1332 stops committing built HTML;
  - #1336 makes dev/test builds use the light art tier.
- The source art is still the bulk of every clone. Measured on `dev` at `877b4807`:

  | tree | working-tree size | tracked files | what it is |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `art/` | 1.6 GB | 6,536 | authoring sources: reference sheets, pose studies, outfit and weapon sets, map sources, inspection pages |
  | `assets/` | 194 MB | 5,265 | full-resolution runtime art (5,201 files that ship), 41 authoring-only files in `equipment/components/` (39 WebP reference strips, a README and a manifest), and **23 non-art files** (below) |
  | `assets-mobile/` | 27 MB | 5,201 | the light tier, generated from `assets/` by `tools/mobile-art.mjs` |
  | `map-detail/`, `music/` | 12 MB, 5.6 MB | 116 + 5 | runtime data that both tiers ship |
  | `docs/preview/` | 161 MB | — | screenshots; stays, with new screenshots capped (owner) |

- The high-res tier does not need to be in this repo for now (owner, 2026-09-26).
  Dev/test builds already ship the light tier only.

## Owner decisions this plan follows (2026-09-26)

1. **Where the originals go:** a **tarball attached to a GitHub Release** (for
   example `hd-assets-v1`), **not Git LFS**. LFS is billed per account.
2. **A committed manifest** lists every file: path, sha256, size and pixel
   dimensions. It is `art-manifest.json` from #1338
   (`tools/art-manifest.mjs`).
3. **A fetch tool** downloads a release and checks every hash before anything
   uses it.
4. **`art/` moves too.** `art/` (the source art) moves out with the high-res
   originals. `docs/preview` stays, with new screenshot sizes capped.
5. **History is left alone:** no rewrite and no force-push. The owner asks GitHub
   Support to purge the old LFS build objects.

## Where it goes

A new repository, **`cehinds/AshenSpire-art`**, holds:

- **`art/`:** the authoring sources, as plain Git (they have never been in LFS),
  plus `assets/equipment/components/`: its 39 WebP strips are modelling and
  inventory-art references (CREDITS.md), never shipped (`tools/assetmime.mjs`
  excludes them), so they are source art and move with its README and manifest.
- **`hd/assets/`:** the full-resolution runtime art, as plain Git. It is the
  reviewable source of every release, so an art change is a normal PR there.
- **A pack script and CI:** they build `hd-assets-v<N>.zip` and its
  `art-manifest.json` from `hd/assets/`, and verify one against the other.
- **Releases `hd-assets-v<N>`:** each has the `.zip` and `art-manifest.json`
  attached. Only the owner publishes a release.

This repository keeps:

- `assets-mobile/` (the light tier) — *(superseded: it moves to the art repo and is generated there, [EXTERNAL-ASSETS-PLAN.md](./EXTERNAL-ASSETS-PLAN.md) step 9)*;
- `map-detail/` and `music/` — *(superseded: they move to the art repo's `common` pack, [EXTERNAL-ASSETS-PLAN.md](./EXTERNAL-ASSETS-PLAN.md) step 9)*;
- `art-manifest.json` (derived, as today) and **`art-release.json`**, the
  authored pin: the release's repo, tag, zip name and zip sha256. The pin is its
  own file because `--write` regenerates the manifest from the trees. Both
  **join the build identity** (`BUILD_IDENTITY_FILES` in `tools/buildversion.mjs`)
  in the step-4 PR that first builds full art from the fetched cache: from then
  on the digest no longer sees the full art itself, so moving the pin must move
  the build number. (While `assets/` is still here both files are derived from
  inputs the digest already covers.) That PR also adds the two root files to
  every sandbox that copies the repo and builds or serves it: doorplant's
  `COPY_SET`, `tools/bundle.test.mjs`, `tools/sfx-filename-convention.mjs` and
  the rest a `git grep mkdtempSync` finds, or `sourceDigest` refuses there;
- `tools/fetch-art.mjs`;
- **the 23 non-art files that were under `assets/`**, moved in step 4 (#1367) to the
  tracked root folder **`asset-data/`**, at the same path below it
  (`assets/equipment/manifest.json` is now `asset-data/equipment/manifest.json`;
  `content/` accepts only compiled sources). `asset-data` is one of the
  `INPUT_ROOTS` in `tools/buildversion.mjs`, so the digest and row B still sweep
  these files. Ship tools that write a manifest beside art under `assets/` write
  it to the matching `asset-data/` folder instead (`tools/asset-data.mjs`).
  They are:
  - 12 JSON manifests: `equipment/manifest.json`, `poses/pose-sprites.manifest.json`,
    `sprites/class-sprites.manifest.json` and others;
  - `framework/silence.txt`, named as a source path by `src/framework/data/assets.js`;
  - `fonts/OFL.txt`;
  - the scripts and notes under `assets/classes/` (now `asset-data/classes/`).

### How an art change flows after the move

1. A PR in AshenSpire-art changes `hd/assets/` (or `art/` and a ship tool).
2. The owner publishes `hd-assets-v<N+1>`.
3. A PR here bumps the pin in `art-release.json`, runs
   `tools/fetch-art.mjs`, and regenerates `assets-mobile/` with
   `tools/mobile-art.mjs` from the fetched cache. `art-manifest.mjs --check`
   then confirms that the light and high tiers agree. *(Superseded by
   [EXTERNAL-ASSETS-PLAN.md](./EXTERNAL-ASSETS-PLAN.md): the art repo generates
   the light tier and releases it with the high and common packs, and the PR
   here only bumps the pin. Step 2 is the merge in the art repo, because
   releases are automatic.)*

## Every reader of `art/` and `assets/`, and what each becomes

### Readers of `assets/` (the high tier)

| reader | when it runs | reads | becomes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tools/bundle.mjs --light` / `--mobile` | **every dev/test build** (ci.yml, dev-preview.yml, launch.mjs) | walks `assets/` as the reference list the twins must mirror | reads the id list from `art-manifest.json`; no fetch needed |
| `tools/bundle.mjs --full-art` | release/main builds, including pages-builds' main build | `assets/` | `.art-cache/hd-assets-v<N>/` filled by `tools/fetch-art.mjs`; each of those jobs fetches first |
| `tools/mobile-art.mjs --check` | **every push** (ci.yml, dev-preview.yml) | sizes `assets/` against its twins | *(superseded)* moves to the art repo's CI with the light tier; here `art-manifest.mjs --check` compares the pinned release (EXTERNAL-ASSETS-PLAN steps 9, 11) |
| `tools/mobile-art.mjs` (regenerate) | when art changes | `assets/` | *(superseded)* runs in the art repo, from `hd/assets/` (EXTERNAL-ASSETS-PLAN step 9) |
| `tools/credits-check.mjs` | every push (ci.yml) | enumerates `assets/*` folders | enumerates the manifest's id prefixes |
| `tools/verify-external.mjs` | every push (dev-preview.yml) | takes its file list from `assets/` | takes it from the manifest (full or light tier by the page's edition) |
| `tools/hand-side-probe.mjs` | every push (ci.yml, dev-preview.yml) | `existsSync` on `assets/equipment/*`; measures pixels served from `assets/` | measures the light tier (baselines re-measured in that PR), or fetches for a full-art run |
| dev-preview "Collect the playable build" | every push | `cp -r assets/environments`, `pose-effects`, `combat-effects`, `painted-outfits` into `preview/` | copies from the built web edition (which already carries the tier's art) |
| `tests/run-node.mjs` check 33 | every test run | reads `assets/equipment/manifest.json` (it warns and skips without it) | reads it from its new home in this repo; **it must not start skipping** — **done in #1367**: reads `asset-data/equipment/manifest.json` |
| `tests/run-node.mjs` check 49 (`assetExists`) | every test run | stats files under `assets/` | checks ids against the manifest |
| `tests/run-node.mjs` check 79 (pose frames) | every test run | `existsSync` on every generated frame under `POSE_DIR` (`assets/poses/`) | checks the frame ids against the manifest |
| `tools/bundle.test.mjs` (parse gate, EOL corpus) | every CI run (`ci.yml`, `tests.yml`) | its sandboxes copy `assets/`, run the unflagged (full-art) bundler, and read `assets/bg/bg_act1.webp` | sandboxes copy `assets-mobile/` and build with `--light`; the EOL corpus reads the light twin |
| `tools/content-build.mjs --mutate` (M6/M7) | by hand and its self-test | sweeps the real `assets/` and copies it into fixtures; M6 renames `assets/sprites/enemy_wanderingSoldier.webp` | builds its fixture tree from the manifest's ids (placeholder bytes, as its other cases already write) |
| `tests/content-expansion-equipment.test.mjs` | every test run | `existsSync` on `assets/equipment/icon_*`, `weapon_*`, `body_*` | checks ids against the manifest |
| `tools/rogue-parity.mjs` (spawned by `tests/content-validators.test.mjs`) | every test run | `existsSync` on `assets/sprites/rogue_*.webp` and `assets/equipment/body_rogue_*.webp` | checks ids against the manifest |
| `tests/environment-art.test.mjs`, `tests/relic-art.test.mjs` | every test run | `existsSync` on every environment, world-map and painted-relic path | check ids against the manifest |
| `tools/buildversion-selftest.mjs` (run by `buildversion --selftest` in `ci.yml`'s reproducible job) | every CI run | copies `assets/` into its corpus; a planted case edits `assets/classes/successor-packet.manifest.json` | copies the kept non-art folder instead of `assets/`, and plants on that file's new path, in the same PR that moves it — **#1367** plants on `asset-data/classes/successor-packet.manifest.json` and copies `asset-data/`; it still copies `assets/` too, because `assets/` is still an input root until the high-tier readers are switched |
| output-only writers: `tools/concept-cutout.mjs` and `tools/pose-cutout.mjs` (`assets/sprites`), `tools/parchment.mjs` (`assets/map`), `tools/reaver-attack-animation.mjs` (`assets/animations`) | when art changes | nothing; they **write** under `assets/` | move to AshenSpire-art with the ship tools, writing into its `hd/assets/`, so their output enters a release |
| `src/framework/data/assets.js` | runtime data | names `assets/framework/silence.txt` | names `asset-data/framework/silence.txt` (#1367; set in `content/framework/assets.json`, regenerated) |
| `tools/screenshot.mjs` | by hand | reads `assets/sprites/class-sprites.manifest.json` | reads it from its new home: `asset-data/sprites/class-sprites.manifest.json` (#1367) |
| `styles/kit.css` | every build | `../assets/fonts/*` | *(superseded)* fonts are one `common` record each and load at runtime through `ASSET_CSS` (EXTERNAL-ASSETS-PLAN step 3b) |
| README (`npx serve .`, `python -m http.server`) and DEVELOPER ("any static server works") | local dev | a plain static server serves `/assets/…` from disk | the docs name `node tools/serve.mjs` as the way to run from source, because a plain server cannot remap `/assets/…`; the built `AshenSpire.html` still needs no server |
| `tools/serve.mjs` | local dev | serves the repo root, so `/assets/…` is the full art | *(superseded)* maps every id to the fetch cache's light and common packs by default, and to the kept non-art files for those that are not assets; `--hd` serves the high pack (EXTERNAL-ASSETS-PLAN step 12) |
| `pose-studio/package.mjs`, `editor/server.mjs` | by hand | four `assets/*` trees; `editor` walks all of `assets/` | read the fetched cache (and `art/` below) |

### Readers of `art/` (source art)

| reader | when it runs | becomes |
|---|---|---|
| ship tools: `pose-ship`, `painted-outfits-ship`, `painted-items-ship`, `readiness-poses-ship`, `combat-effects-ship`, `environment-art-build`, `map-detail-build`, `card-effect-art-build` | when art changes | move to AshenSpire-art; their output lands in `hd/assets/` there |
| checks: `painted-outfits-check`, `painted-items-check`, `card-effect-art-check`, `card-effect-layers-check` | by hand / art PRs | move with the ship tools |
| browser QA: `sword-shield-`, `twin-sword-`, `unarmed-animation-browser` | by hand | move to AshenSpire-art |
| `tools/readiness-preview-build.mjs` | **every push** (dev-preview.yml) | reads `art/readiness-poses/preview.html`; that page moves to AshenSpire-art's own preview workflow, and this step is dropped here in the same PR |
| dev-preview copies of `art/…/inspection`, `art/pose-studio`, `art/card-effect-refresh-…` | every push | published from AshenSpire-art's preview workflow |
| `pose-studio/package.mjs`, `editor/server.mjs` | by hand | read a local AshenSpire-art checkout (a path setting), or move there |
| tests: `dagger-animation`, `twin-sword-animation`, `unarmed-animation`, `unarmed-magic`, `prologue`, `combat-prototypes-ui` | every test run | the source-art parts move to AshenSpire-art's CI; the runtime parts read `assets-mobile/`, the manifest or small committed fixtures |

**The tables are a starting inventory, not the whole of it.** Step 4's first
PR records the complete one: every file under `tools/`, `tests/`, `src/`,
`.github/` and `pose-studio/` that `git grep -n "assets/"` finds on `dev` (15 tools
alone on 0.7.1), each classified as reads the high tier, reads a kept non-art
file, writes art, or names an id only through `assetUrl()`. Each gets a row
here, and no reader is left for step 6's grep to find.

**No test is skipped, weakened or deleted to get green.** A check that loses its
input moves along with it, or gets the same input from the manifest.

## Sequence

Each step is one reviewed PR, or one owner action.

1. **Owner:** create `cehinds/AshenSpire-art` and answer Q1 (public or private).
2. **PR in AshenSpire-art:** import `art/` and `assets/` (as `hd/assets/`) from
   this repo's `dev`, with a pointer to the source commit. History stays here.
   Add the pack script and the CI that verifies it.
3. **Owner:** publish release `hd-assets-v1` from that PR's merge.
4. **PR here — readers stop needing `assets/`:**
   - Add `tools/fetch-art.mjs`. It downloads the pinned release, checks the
     zip's sha256 and then every file's sha256 against the manifest, unpacks
     into `.art-cache/` (gitignored), and refuses on any mismatch.
   - Pin the tag and hash in `art-release.json`.
   - Move the 23 non-art files.
   - Add `art-manifest.json` and `art-release.json` to `BUILD_IDENTITY_FILES`, with the sandbox copies that need them (above), in the PR that first builds full art from the cache.
   - Switch every `assets/` reader in the first table to the manifest, or to a
     fetch in the jobs that build full art.
5. **PR here — readers stop needing `art/`:** move or repoint every reader in the
   second table. Delete nothing that still has a reader.
6. **PR here — delete** (folded into [EXTERNAL-ASSETS-PLAN.md](./EXTERNAL-ASSETS-PLAN.md) step 13, which still needs this step's own go-ahead): remove `art/` and the art under `assets/` from the `dev`
   tree and add them to `.gitignore`.
   - **Precondition:** `git grep -nE "['\"\`/](art|assets)/"` outside `assets-mobile`
     and the manifest finds only fetch-aware code, or ids resolved through
     `src/ui/assetmap.js`.
   - The PR lists that grep's output.
   - History is untouched.
7. **Owner, separately:** ask GitHub Support to purge the old LFS build objects
   (about 47.6 GB, 306 objects since 2026-09-19, as reported to the owner).
   - **Precondition:** `release` and `main` no longer track LFS HTML (their
     promotions carry #1332), and `pages-builds` no longer checks out with
     `lfs: true` or reads purged historical builds.
   - Otherwise that job, and the Pages history it assembles, break.
   - Old commits lose their embedded builds; the owner has accepted that.

`release` and `main` are untouched until the owner promotes these changes.

## What it buys, and what it does not

- **This repo stops growing with art.** New art lands in AshenSpire-art instead.
- **A plain clone does not get smaller.** Git keeps the old blobs in history, and
  step 7 purges LFS objects only. A shallow or blobless clone (`--depth 1`,
  `--filter=blob:none`) does lose the ~1.8 GB working-tree weight once step 6
  lands. A smaller full clone would need a history rewrite, which is out of
  scope and the owner's call alone.
- **Release assets cost nothing to store or download, and each version keeps a
  permanent URL.** No file here comes near the 2 GiB per-asset limit: the
  largest single file in `art/` or `assets/` is under 50 MB.

## Owner answers (2026-09-26)

- Q1. **Private.** `cehinds/AshenSpire-art` is a private repository. *(Superseded 2026-09-27: the repository becomes public, and the token bullets below stop applying once it is; see [Owner answer: the art repository becomes public](#owner-answer-2026-09-27-the-art-repository-becomes-public).)*
  - CI in this repo cannot read its releases with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`. The jobs that fetch (full-art builds, pages-builds' main build) read a repository secret `ART_REPO_TOKEN`: a fine-grained token with read-only *Contents* access to `AshenSpire-art`. The owner creates it; step 4 names the secret and fails with that name when it is missing.
  - `tools/fetch-art.mjs` reads the same token from `ART_REPO_TOKEN` (or `GITHUB_TOKEN`) for a local fetch.
  - A private release is downloadable only by people with access to the repo, so it does not by itself reach players who want **Local high-res**; the owner decided on 2026-09-27 that it stays that way (below).
- Q2. **Zip.** Releases are `hd-assets-v<N>.zip`.
- Q3. **Yes.** Go ahead with steps 1–4; steps 5–7 each still need their own go-ahead.
- #1332 is approved for promotion to `release` (the owner merges it there).

## Status

- Steps 1–3 are done (2026-09-26). The owner created `cehinds/AshenSpire-art` (private for now; the owner decided on 2026-09-27 to make it public, not yet done). [AshenSpire-art#1](https://github.com/cehinds/AshenSpire-art/pull/1) imported `hd/assets/` (5,201 files) and `art/`, and its release workflow published `hd-assets-v1`: zip sha256 `c03e4024…88a4`, the same bytes as a local pack of that commit.
- Step 4 has started. `tools/fetch-art.mjs` landed in #1340, and #1353 pins `hd-assets-v1` in `art-release.json`. #1367 moved the 23 non-art files to `asset-data/` and switched every reader of them (tools, tests, `src/framework/data/assets.js`, the ship tools that write those manifests, the art pages that fetch `enemy-poses/manifest.json`, CREDITS and the docs). Still to do: switch the `assets/` (high-tier) readers. Both files joined `BUILD_IDENTITY_FILES` at [EXTERNAL-ASSETS-PLAN.md](./EXTERNAL-ASSETS-PLAN.md) step 11, which also pins `hd-assets-v2` (three zips, schema 2) and fetches each pack into `.art-cache/<tag>/<pack>/`.
- Releases are automatic: the art repo publishes the next `hd-assets-v<N>` on every merge to `main` that changes the pack ([AshenSpire-art#2](https://github.com/cehinds/AshenSpire-art/pull/2)).

## Owner answer (2026-09-27)

*(Superseded later the same day by the next section: the repository, the
high-res zip included, becomes public. FINISH D20 is superseded by D22.)*

- **The high-res zip stays private.** It is published only as the `hd-assets-v<N>` releases of the private `cehinds/AshenSpire-art` repository and is **not** attached to public AshenSpire releases. The Local high-res setting therefore reaches only people with access to that repository.

## Owner answer (2026-09-27): the art repository becomes public

Answering [EXTERNAL-ASSETS-PLAN.md](./EXTERNAL-ASSETS-PLAN.md#owner-answers-2026-09-27)
question 1, the owner chose to make **`cehinds/AshenSpire-art` public**
(FINISH D22, superseding D20 and the answer above):

- Everything in it becomes public, the `hd-assets-v<N>` releases and their
  high-res zip included. Players who want **Local high-res** can download the
  zip from those releases. It is still not attached to AshenSpire releases.
- No `ART_REPO_TOKEN` is needed to fetch a release. `tools/fetch-art.mjs`
  keeps the token optional (`ART_REPO_TOKEN`, else `GITHUB_TOKEN`), sent only
  when set, to raise GitHub's rate limit. CI needs no secret.
- **Pending owner action:** flipping the visibility in the repository's GitHub
  settings is not done yet. Until it is, a fetch needs the token: CI passes
  the `ART_REPO_TOKEN` secret in the env of every step that fetches, and a
  local fetch reads `ART_REPO_TOKEN` (else `GITHUB_TOKEN`). The flip must
  happen before EXTERNAL-ASSETS-PLAN step 11 (its step 10a); the token path in
  `fetch-art` is only a belt-and-braces fallback. Once the repository is
  public, the same code needs no token and nothing else changes.
