# Enemy roster and destinations

20 regular enemies, 3 elites and 10 bosses across three acts. Existing enemies and saved combat state retain their authored behavior. All enemies use the shared combat frame and move-card inspector.

Move cards show base values except the current intent, which uses the engine preview. Status effects attached to moves can still apply when Block absorbs physical damage; Dodge grants Block rather than guaranteed avoidance. Charged attacks expose their windup and charging Block.

The twelve painted portraits imported from the Unity fork remain unchanged. Fourteen new transparent portraits share their 384 × 384 frame, left-facing orientation and foot anchor. These are idle paintings animated with action-specific movement, not frame-by-frame attack strips. Authored actor and move overrides take precedence over card tags, then intent families; reduced-motion settings suppress action movement. Existing native art remains available for the other enemies and as a loading fallback.

HP below is as authored. Since #1284 a boss is scaled by the tier it is met at, whichever region holds it (`balance.bossTiers`, SPEC §13.3): its region's tier ratio on HP and move damage, then ×0.8 HP and damage as a first boss, ×2.2 HP and ×1.5 damage as a second or final boss.

## Verification and limits

- All 46 new moves execute through the engine, including damage, Block, status, healing, card effects and delays. All seven new boss phases are covered.
- Paired seeded tests cover encounter selection, move locks and repeat limits. Map tests cover all ten destinations and old/new save round trips.
- All 19 original enemy definitions and eight-turn combat continuations were compared against the pre-expansion registry.
- Twelve automated campaigns and all 28 new-boss/class combinations resolved without crashes. These are integration checks, not a win-rate balance claim.
- Pressure tuning preserves boss HP, phase thresholds and windups. Starter-kit direct boss fights do not represent normal act progression or developed decks.
- Enemy rewards remain the existing normal/elite/boss reward rules. No alternate destination grants a new reward economy.
