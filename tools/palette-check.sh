# tools/palette-check.sh — gate on tools/palette-probe.html.
#
# Answers one question with an exit status: is the armour-separation metric in
# tools/palette-audit.py measuring what it is used to claim?
#
#   bash tools/palette-check.sh              run, print evidence, gate
#   bash tools/palette-check.sh --plates DIR also write the fixture PNGs there
#   bash tools/palette-check.sh --selftest   re-run the three-exit-code proof below,
#                                            by planting in a real copy of this tree
#
# It runs three instruments, in increasing cost, and keeps a BROKEN INSTRUMENT and a
# REAL FINDING ABOUT THE ART on separate exit codes — conflating them is how a content
# problem gets "fixed" by editing a threshold:
#
#   1. palette-audit.py --selfcheck      pure maths, no Blender, no browser
#   2. palette-probe.html                the shipped .webp through Chromium
#   3. palette-audit.py --source-audit   the authored hex in outfits.csv
#
# Exit codes
#   0    every declared check UPHELD and no content collision
#   1    a check was REFUTED or UNKNOWN (silence is not a pass) — instrument/regression
#   2    no evidence block at all — the page never finished
#   3    two consecutive runs disagreed (determinism lost)
#   4    instruments are fine; the ART has a collision (source audit tripped)
#   127  no browser found; every candidate tried is printed
#
# The probe declares each expected verdict BEFORE measuring, so this script can
# only ever agree or disagree with a declaration that is already in the artifact.
#
# ── CI DOES NOT RUN THIS. A GREEN CI RUN SAYS NOTHING ABOUT COLOUR. ───────────
# Checked at the merge of dev @ 5315249, which brought this repo its first
# workflow: .github/workflows/ci.yml contains no reference to palette-check.sh,
# palette-audit.py or palette-probe.html in any of its four jobs. So none of the
# 20 declared checks below runs per commit. Under SOP 2's silence guard that makes
# every claim in this directory `unknown` in CI — and unknown blocks, it does not
# read green. Stated here because a green run on a branch carrying this file is an
# absence that looks like a result, which is the one shape this house keeps
# finding. The `boundary` job says "nothing here RENDERS"; it does not yet say
# "nothing here checks whether two armour sets are separated", and that sentence
# is the accurate one.
#
# THE EXIT-CODE CONTRACT, for whoever wires it in — and it is not "just add a
# step", which is why I did not add one to another seat's workflow:
#   1, 2, 3  MUST block. Broken instrument, no evidence, determinism lost.
#   127      MUST block, as `unknown` — never a pass. No browser is not a clean bill.
#   4        MUST NOT block while the content call is held for Constantine. Exit 4
#            is a live finding about the palettes (reaver default|warden), not a
#            regression, and a gate that is red-by-design on an unmade decision
#            teaches everyone to ignore the gate. It needs to be VISIBLE and
#            non-blocking until someone repaints, then blocking forever after.
# Wiring that split is Rune's file and Marina's sequence, not mine to self-grant.
#
# ── REMOVAL CONDITION (SOP 1's corollary) ─────────────────────────────────────
# This script has no life of its own — it is the exit status of
# tools/palette-probe.html. It dies with the probe (that file's own REMOVAL
# CONDITION block lists five clauses and names this script in clause 1), and it
# ALSO dies on one condition of its own:
#
#   the exit-code split stops meaning anything. The whole reason this file exists
#   rather than a one-line `chrome --dump-dom | grep` is that exit 1 (broken
#   instrument) and exit 4 (real finding about the art) must never be the same
#   number — conflating them is how a content problem gets "fixed" by moving a
#   threshold. Test it: break the probe (invert one `expect`) and separately break
#   the art (edit one outfits.csv hex to collide). If both come back as the same
#   exit code, this script has stopped doing its only job and goes. Do not repair
#   it by adding a flag.
#
# THAT TEST IS RUN, NOT ASSERTED — AND SINCE 2026-08-15 IT IS RE-RUN BY `--selftest`
# RATHER THAN REMEMBERED. What follows is the original observation, and it was a
# ONE-OFF: a hand procedure in a throwaway tree, recorded in this comment and
# never runnable again. Under SOP 2's drift clause a ref-pinned observation is
# `unknown (drifted)` at every later ref, so by the time Vira's doors audit ran
# (2026-08-14) this file's evidence had rotted — and the audit filed it under
# HARNESS/exempt, which is a second thing to correct: this script's whole output
# is an exit code with a five-way contract. It asserts, therefore it is a check,
# therefore the instrument rule binds it. Both corrections are mine; the file is
# mine. `--selftest` plants the same three states in a real copy of the tree and
# requires the same three exit codes, so the paragraph below is now a description
# of something a reader can watch happen instead of something they must believe.
#
# THE ORIGINAL OBSERVATION, kept because it is the record of why the split exists:
# I ran it 2026-07-27 in a throwaway `git archive`
# extraction of HEAD with these three files copied in, and observed THREE DISTINCT
# exit codes — so the split is measured, not a claim in a comment:
#
#   exit 1  instrument broken, art untouched. Inverted D10's predicate
#           (`satHue > 90` -> `> 900`). Result: CHECKS 20 UPHELD 19 REFUTED 1,
#           REFUTED_IDS D10, and the run STOPPED before stage 3 — a broken
#           instrument never gets to emit a verdict about the art.
#   exit 4  art collides, instruments clean. The unmodified tree, today:
#           20/20 UPHELD, then reaver default|warden closest on 3 of 4 materials.
#   exit 0  both clean. Repainted warden's four hexes to a violet in the throwaway
#           tree: 20/20 UPHELD and SOURCE AUDIT PASS. This is the one that matters
#           most — it proves exit 4 is a FINDING about these palettes and not a
#           permanent red that everyone learns to ignore, and it names the shape of
#           the fix (repaint warden away from default) without repainting anything.

DOOR: every plant above is an edit to a REAL FILE in a real copy of this tree, and each arm runs the
      UNMODIFIED tools/palette-check.sh from that copy. The known-bad travels python's selfcheck, the
      browser rendering the shipped .webp plates through a canvas, the DOM evidence block, the
      determinism re-run and the source audit over the real outfits.csv. Nothing is handed to a
      function and no verdict here is computed by the selftest.
NOT PASSED: exit 2 (no evidence block) and exit 3 (determinism lost) have NO plant — they are declared
      states with no known-bad, so they remain `unknown`, not green. Exit 127 (no browser) likewise.
      This proves the 1 / 4 / 0 split, which is the split the removal condition is about.
BOUNDARY: one Linux box, one Chromium, the authored hex and the shipped plates as they stand. Silent
      on whether any pair READS as two suits at in-game size — that still needs an eye, as stage 3 says.
