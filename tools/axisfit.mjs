// tools/axisfit.mjs — LAW 5's machine check. On a narrow shape, every scroll
// container's horizontal travel is ZERO, or the container names its own
// exemption, in the code, with its reason.
//
// Bjorn, 2026-08-08, on Constantine's word:
//
//   "for mobile, if possible, I should only be scrolling up and down, rarely
//    left and right. so if you need to rearrange things to keep everything
//    visible in the vertical dimension, then do so"
//
// Law 5 is house law (commons/laws.md) and is not restated here — the family
// repo is its home and this file is its enforcement pointer. What lives HERE is
// only the mechanism.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AND tools/mobilefit.mjs DOES NOT ANSWER IT
//
// mobilefit sweeps 32 shapes, passes, and is SILENT about this axis. Its
// horizontal reading is `documentElement.scrollWidth - clientWidth`, and this
// app is `overflow: hidden` at the root, so that number is ZERO BY
// CONSTRUCTION at every shape — measured, not assumed: across 14 surfaces x 5
// shapes at cd3da94 the document itself never once appeared as a scroller. Its
// `clipped()` walk then deliberately SKIPS any element with a scrolling
// ancestor, and its bleed set is `.combat *`. Three mechanisms, none of which
// can see a scroller three elements down on a screen that is not combat.
//
// GREEN ON 32 SHAPES WAS SILENCE ABOUT THE AXIS, NOT COVERAGE OF IT. So the
// unit here is the SCROLL CONTAINER, never the document, and the surface
// population is every ?shot= state, not one board.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE POPULATION, STATED, BECAUSE A SHAPE LIST AND A TOLERANCE ARE THE SAME
// OBJECT — a boundary drawn around the cells its author already looked at.
// I cut a shape list and invented a fitted tolerance in one file in one hour
// once. So each edge of this one says who drew it and whether a machine can:
//
//   SURFACES — DERIVED, not typed. A regex over src/main.js's `shotState ===`
//     comparisons, the same home tools/release-shots.mjs reads, with the same
//     two floors it learned the hard way: zero derived states is a FINDING (an
//     empty denominator is not full coverage), and any derived state neither
//     measured nor excluded BY NAME is a FINDING. I cannot shorten this list
//     without the tool saying so.
//   DRIVEN OVERLAYS — A TYPED LIST OF THREE, and the weakest edge in this file.
//     They have no ?shot= state, so nothing derives them; the settings tab
//     strip is one of the offenders Law 5 names by name, and leaving it out
//     because it is awkward would be the boundary drawn around the easy cells.
//     An overlay whose opener does not fire is `unknown` and RED — never a skip.
//   SHAPES — the app decides, not me. A shape is in scope iff the app itself
//     rendered `data-layout="narrow"` there. No width threshold appears in this
//     file. The GEOMETRY fed in is still a typed list, and it is a second copy
//     of the one in mobilefit.mjs — so `assertShapesAgree()` below reads that
//     file and fails if the two ever disagree. A second copy WITH something
//     checking they agree is not the defect; a second copy with nothing is.
//   TEXT SIZE — ONE CELL by default, and it MATTERS: at 390x844 `.hand` runs
//     200px at Text M and 326px at Text XL, and the event screen 18 -> 22.
//     `--text S|M|L|XL` reaches the other cells; the default run does not sweep
//     them and this is printed in the boundary rather than left to be found.
//
//   NO TOLERANCE. Zero is zero — clause 2 of the law says a threshold is not an
//   exemption, "a number a layout can sneak under is how 401px becomes normal
//   one commit at a time." The proof is on this tree: the SMALLEST offender is
//   the event screen at 18px. Any tolerance I could have fitted to the map's
//   401 would have hidden it. Chromium reports scrollWidth/clientWidth as
//   integers, so `> 0` needs no epsilon; if a 1px ever appears, the answer is
//   the layout, never a tolerance here.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE EXEMPTION, AND WHY IT IS NOT A LIST IN THIS FILE
//
// Law 5 clause 2: a surface may scroll horizontally only where the horizontal
// run IS the content, "named at the container, in the code, with its reason."
// The house has solved the latch/exemption problem twice already and the answer
// both times was the same: THE EXEMPTION ASSERTS ITS OWN REASON AND FAILS WHEN
// THE REASON DIES.
//
// So there is no allow-list here. A container excuses itself, where it is
// rendered, by carrying:
//
//     data-scroll-axis="x"  data-scroll-axis-why="<why the content IS a run>"
//
// and the check treats that declaration as a claim it can falsify:
//
//   A1  travel > 0 and no declaration            -> FAIL (the law)
//   A2  declaration with no reason, or an empty  -> FAIL (an exemption with no
//       reason, or any value but "x"                reason is a mute button;
//                                                   one word, closed, so the
//                                                   vocabulary cannot widen by
//                                                   accident)
//   A3  declaration and travel > 0               -> excused, printed at volume
//   A4  declaration and travel == 0              -> FAIL (RATCHET). The reason
//       died: either the content stopped being a horizontal run, or this check
//       went blind. Both need a person. An excuse nobody can be forced to
//       revisit is how a suite goes green over a bug.
//
// TWO EXEMPTIONS SHIP. The hand exemption comes from one home
// (src/ui/handAxis.js — no renderer types the string), mode-scoped:
//   · the hand under PAGING — rendered conditionally from
//     <html data-hand-layout>, his D19 word as its reason; the mode axis
//     below keeps it honest (A5). It appears on every surface that mounts the
//     hand, because there is now exactly one thing that mounts a hand.
//
// UNTIL 2026-08-15 THERE WERE TWO, and the second one's death is this file's
// own wake condition firing. coop.js used to render its OWN .hand — a
// pager-only twin with no overlap arm and no reader of the word — so its
// declaration was UNSCOPED (true in every mode), and the wake written beside
// it was: "the day coop grows an overlap arm, the coop[overlap] cells reach
// zero travel and A4 fires on the declaration, forcing a person to re-scope
// it." That is exactly what happened. Viki's renderer collapse gave both
// surfaces src/ui/components/hand.js; the coop hand gained the overlap arm in
// the same act; CM2 below went RED on its dead premise and forced this
// paragraph to be rewritten by a person. The premise did not rot quietly for
// six days — the mechanism caught it inside one act. That is the wake
// condition (development.md) earning its place, so the history stays written
// down rather than tidied away.
// From 2026-08-08 to 2026-08-14 this paragraph opened "ZERO EXEMPTIONS SHIP"
// and named `.hand` as receiving none — that refusal stood on D17 msg 3's word
// and was right; D19's later word is what opened it (the history is spelled
// out under THE MODE AXIS below). The act
// The second is the act map only while the player-enabled Two-axis map dragging
// setting is on. mapboard.js authors both its extent and its declaration; when
// the setting is off it authors neither, so A1 and A4 guard both sides of the
// toggle. Every other scroller remains undecided by design.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE MODE AXIS — Vega, 2026-08-14, on Marina's ruling, and the words are his.
//
// The hand wears two layouts behind one derived word (C2, D19):
// balance.ui.handLayout -> <html data-hand-layout>, 'paging' | 'overlap'. In
// PAGING the strip scrolls sideways BY DESIGN — his word, D19, 2026-08-13,
// verbatim: "overlap and paging". In OVERLAP the whole hand lays inside the
// container and horizontal travel is ZERO — asserted, never excused.
//
// So an exemption on the hand is legal ONLY under paging, and it says so
// itself: a fourth attribute, data-scroll-axis-mode="<mode>", scopes the
// declaration to the mode that designed the run. The check compares it to the
// page's actual <html data-hand-layout>:
//
//   A5  declaration scoped to a mode the page does not render -> FAIL. The
//       exemption may never outlive its mode: a paging declaration sitting in
//       an overlap DOM is either a conditional render that broke or a hand-
//       typed copy, and both are the trap this axis exists to refuse.
//   A5b scoped declaration on a page with no data-hand-layout    -> FAIL (the
//       scope names a word the page no longer speaks; unverifiable is not
//       excused).
//
// And the sweep itself walks BOTH modes through the settings door
// (?shotSettings={"handLayout":...}) on the surface that renders the hand —
// the modes DERIVED from balance.ui.handLayoutModes, the app's own closed
// set, never typed here. Overlap cells assert 0 like any undeclared
// container; paging cells accept the declaration under A3/A4 as ever.
//
// HISTORY, so nobody reads the exemption as convenience: D17 message 3
// (2026-08-08) is Constantine ANNOYED at this exact scroller — "I'm annoyed
// that in mobile, that the default hand size requires me to scroll left and
// right" — and on that word this file refused `.hand` an exemption by name
// (the paragraph above carried that refusal from 2026-08-08). D19
// (2026-08-13) is his later
// word — "overlap and paging" — that makes paging a DESIGNED pager and the
// declaration writable, scoped to that mode alone. The refusal was right when
// it was written and the exemption is right now; both cite him, not us.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE FLOORS, AND THE ONE THAT WAS MISSING — Vira, 2026-08-08, checking gate.
//
// Bjorn floored the DENOMINATOR (zero derived states) and the SCOPE (zero narrow
// cells). He did not floor the thing actually judged. Observed on this tree, at
// dd11e38, no edit to the app:
//
//     $ node tools/axisfit.mjs --dist --only death
//     PASS — every assertion held over 0 asserted container(s) in 4 narrow cell(s).
//     $ echo $?
//     0
//
// Four narrow cells cleared the scope floor; `death` has no scroll container, so
// nothing was judged, and the tool printed a green. That is this file's OWN
// fixture — `verify-shipped: OK — 0 checks passed` — reproduced by the file that
// names it in its own comments. `--only` is the cheapest way to see it; it is
// NOT the dangerous way. The dangerous way needs no flag: the day the app stops
// using native scrollers, or `data-scroll-axis` moves, or the overflow filter
// below stops matching the app's technique, EVERY container vanishes from the
// scan, all 68 narrow cells still count, and the full sweep prints PASS at
// exit 0 over nothing. Measured, not argued: one line changed in SCAN's overflow
// filter turns `FAIL — 41 assertions over 61 containers` into a clean green.
//
// So the floors are now ONE function, `floorVerdict()`, and --selftest calls the
// SAME function main() does — Bjorn's own discipline for judge(), which the two
// population selftests (P1, P3) did not follow: they re-stated their mechanism
// rather than calling it, so they could drift green while main() was red.
//
// A zero-assertion run is `unknown`, and unknown blocks (SOP 2's silence guard).
// It is not a softer bucket than red and it is not a pass.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// KNOWN-BAD FIRST (development.md, The instrument rule). Nothing needed
// authoring to make this falsifiable — the defect was already shipped:
//
//     .map-scroll = 65px horizontal at 390x844, declaration removed in memory
//     integrated milestone = 328d592, dist sha256 89acfa0b15d5
//
// A check whose failing case nobody has watched fail is `unknown`, not green.
// `--selftest` plants all eight of this file's mechanisms in memory and prints
// what went red, INCLUDING the two that must go GREEN — a check that can only
// ever be red is as useless as one that can only ever be green, and only the
// second failure is usually looked for.
//
// Usage
//   node tools/axisfit.mjs                 source tree via tools/serve.mjs
//   node tools/axisfit.mjs --dist          dist/AshenSpire.html (file://; http if pack-shaped — browser.mjs buildPageUrl)
//   node tools/axisfit.mjs --text XL       one other cell of the text axis
//   node tools/axisfit.mjs --only map      one surface (still `unknown` on a typo)
//   node tools/axisfit.mjs --selftest      plant every mechanism, watch it fail
//   CHROME=/path/to/chrome node tools/axisfit.mjs
//
// Exit codes
//   0  every narrow container travelled 0px horizontally, or excused itself
//   1  an assertion failed  (EXPECTED on dev at cd3da94 — that is the point)
//   2  usage / no browser / a surface that would not mount — never a pass
//
// REMOVAL CONDITION (SOP 1's corollary): delete this file the day EldenSpire
// ships no narrow shape — then `data-layout="narrow"` never renders, the scope
// filter selects nothing, and the run says so out loud instead of passing.
//
// REMOVAL CONDITION FOR THE FLOORS (Vira, 2026-08-08, and it is their falsifier):
// floorVerdict() is CUT if ten runs pass with no arm of it ever firing on a real
// invocation — that is the Charter's decoration test, counted rather than judged.
// It is WRONG, and is rewritten rather than deleted, the first time a run this
// file calls green turns out to have judged nothing that mattered: the floor
// counts containers, and a container count is a proxy for coverage, not coverage.

      screen 18 -> 22). --text S|M|L|XL reaches the others; nothing sweeps them.
  (b) SCROLLING, NOT WRAPPING. A strip that answers a narrow shape by wrapping
      to two rows spends VERTICAL and reads 0 here. Law 5 clause 4 governs that
      and this tool is silent on it — the settings tab strip at Text L/XL is
      exactly that case.
  (c) NOT BLEED. An element painted past the viewport edge inside a clipping
      box is not scroll travel; tools/mobilefit.mjs owns bleed and this owns
      travel. The Map-zoom chip row's 424.6px was the first kind.
  (d) THE FRAME AFTER IT SETTLES, on Linux headless Chromium, one machine, no
      thumb and no OS gesture layer. Nothing here says a scroller is REACHABLE
      or usable — only which way it moves.
  (e) DRIVEN SURFACES ARE A TYPED LIST OF ${DRIVEN.length}. Anything reachable only by a
      click that is not in it was not looked at. Specifically: the in-run overlay
      has SIX tabs (MENU_TABS, src/ui/uiContent.js) and this reaches TWO — the
      default and Settings. relics · stats · save · controls are UNSWEPT.
  (f) EVERY SURFACE IS POSED BY ?shot=, at ONE point in a run. ?shot=map and
      ?shot=combat run a real seeded climb, so these are the app's own numbers,
      not a fixture's — but they are the numbers at the ENTRANCE with a starting
      deck. A late-run hand, a full relic shelf or a deeper act is more content
      in the same box and this sweeps none of them. The map deliberately exposes
      horizontal travel while Two-axis map dragging is on; its declaration and
      reason are audited above. The dedicated map-two-axis-pan gate proves that
      mouse, touch and pen can actually move the resulting extent, while
      map-pan-ownership proves the vertical-only setting removes that ownership.
  (g) THE MODE AXIS IS TWO SURFACES. balance.ui.handLayoutModes (${handModes.join('/')}) is
      swept both ways on ${MODE_SURFACES.map((s) => `'?shot=${s}'`).join(' and ')} — combat because it reads
      the word, coop because its hand renderer does NOT (its unscoped declaration
      claims mode-inertness; the overlap cells are the wake that fails A4 the day
