//
// DOES THE SWAP-PRICE COMPARISON READ ON A PHONE. Viki's MR-41 arm 1 made the
// Armoury's swap-cost row CONSULT `swapCostFor()` instead of deriving a second
// number, and then named the question she had not answered and would not:
//
//     "No pixel rendered. Two rows per candidate on a 390 px column is a
//      Law 5 question for the Player-experience seat."
//
// This is that pixel, and this is the seat. Bjorn keeps rendered proof — that a
// screen APPEARED. This asks the different question: whether a person can USE
// what appeared. The two are not the same gate and this file is not his.
//
// THE DOOR IS THE CONTENT DOOR, and it is stated because a check that reaches
// its subject by any other route is measuring a screen no author can produce.
// One row appended to `content/source/weapons.csv` — `self.swapCost=+2` —
// `node tools/content-build.mjs`, ZERO code. That is Viki's own plant (identical
// bytes but for one tag) and it is Law 0's falsifier run as an act rather than
// quoted. THE ONE DIFFERENCE, named rather than buried: her row's tags are
// `charm`, mine are `charm|basic`. `basic` is the found-gate answer
// (`balance.equipment.basicTag`) — without it a talisman with `dropWeight 0` is
// authored, compiled, and UNREACHABLE BY ANY PLAYER, so there is no picker to
// photograph. It changes no price: the category rung reads `heavy`/`flourish`
// and the charm carries neither, before or after.
//
// WHAT IT ASSERTS, and every one of these is somebody else's number, not mine:
//
//   L5  Law 5 clause 1 — horizontal travel is ZERO on every scroll container of
//       this surface, measured PER CONTAINER (the document's own reading is
//       zero by construction under a fullscreen `overflow: hidden` app and is
//       printed labelled, never counted). Boundary: 0 px. Not mine — his.
//   L4  Law 4 clause 4 — the only control on the surface (`<summary>`) clears
//       the tap floor. Both sides MEASURED, tapsize.mjs's method: a probe div
//       sized by `var(--tap-floor)` and the summary itself, in device px after
//       `body { zoom }`. Boundary: the floor. Not mine.
//   L2  Law 2 — every comparison row proven inside its own container's rendered
//       rect, AND every chip's text proven inside its own box. Not mine.
//   ONE WORD — a price and a sentence must not be printed with nothing between
//       them. Boundary: ANY positive separation, the weakest claim that can
//       still fail. Not a threshold, deliberately: "how much gap is enough"
//       would be a number of mine with no cell either side.
//   LINE BUDGET — ADDED 2026-08-15, and it is here because this file PRINTED the
//       number that would have caught a real regression and did not read it.
//       `li-lines == head-lines + note-lines`, and `head-lines == 1`. The
//       expected li-count is DERIVED from the note measured on the same run, so
//       the 3 under a declining rule and the 1 under `gear` are typed nowhere in
//       this file — Law 0 clause 1 read as a rule about instruments. Full story
//       at the check itself.
//   UNMOVED AND UNEXPLAINED — a price that did not move, on a picker promising a
//       delta, carries a note. BY PRESENCE, NEVER BY PHRASE. This was watched
//       only from inside `--selftest` until now, which is a check that cannot
//       fail on a real tree.
//   UNKNOWN IS NEVER GREEN — an ERR neighbourhood cell, an unswept width, or an
//       unmeasurable text column FAILS rather than printing a dash inside a
//       table of facts.
//
// SOME OF THESE ARE RED ON WHATEVER TREE YOU POINT THIS AT, which is why
// `--selftest` scores every plant against an UNPLANTED CONTROL and PRINTS the
// control's finding count rather than naming one here. On a tree that already
// exits 1, "the planted copy exited 1" is not evidence of anything — and a
// number typed into this header is a second copy of a count the run derives.
//
// WHAT IT REPORTS AND REFUSES TO ASSERT, and why — because I was told to, and
// because Vira sharpened my own rule this morning into the thing that binds me:
// A POPULATION WITH NO CELL EITHER SIDE OF ITS OWN BOUNDARY CANNOT TELL YOU THE
// BOUNDARY IS WRONG. Eleven declared thresholds in `tools/`, one with cells
// either side, and those synthetic. So the numbers below that WOULD be a
// threshold of my own invention — how many rows is a wall, how many wrapped
// lines is too many, how narrow a text column stops reading — are PRINTED WITH
// THEIR NEIGHBOURHOOD and asserted by nobody. A number I made up, asserted,
// with no cell either side of it, would be the twelfth.
//
//   ROWS      rows per candidate, per rule, with the shipped population beside
//             it — 0 rows (a weapon under flat), 1 row (a weapon under
//             category), 2 rows (the charm). Real cells, all three doors.
//   COLUMN    the text column's own width in CSS px after the indents.
//
// WRAP HAS MOVED OUT OF THAT LIST, 2026-08-15, and the move is the act of the
// day rather than a tidy-up. The line counts were in it — printed, asserted by
// nobody — and a regression walked straight through the gap: Viki's grid attempt
// took li-lines 3 → 4 in this very table while every assertion stayed green.
// Reported-and-unasserted was the right posture for a number I would have had to
// INVENT; it was never the right posture for a number the tree DERIVES. The
// three that remain above are still nobody's, and for the original reason: "how
// narrow a column stops reading" and "how many rows is a wall" have no cell
// either side, so a person rules on them and this exit code does not.
//
// THE VOCABULARY CENSUS is the half only this seat asks. `Flat does not charge
// gear — +2 not applied.` is TRUE. This counts, over the game's own
// player-facing prose, how many times a player could ever have met the word
// `gear` before this sentence hands it to them. A true sentence a person cannot
// parse is a different defect from a false one; the count is the evidence, the
// ruling is in my log.

// ---- THE INK READER, ABSORBED FROM linebudget-camera.mjs (#179) ------------
// Vira's card, and it is one sentence: CAPTURE IS NOT READING. This file called
// Page.captureScreenshot at four sites and wrote every PNG straight to disk
// without ever looking at one — it held the thing and discarded it, while a
// second tool existed only to look. These two functions are that tool's
// working half, moved here whole; \`linebudget-camera.mjs\` is deleted in the
// same commit, per its own removal condition.
//
// WHAT THE MOVE COSTS, said out loud because it is the real work of this card
// and not the seventy-five lines: Bjorn's independence claim was "the two
// readings share no code path below the DOM." Sharing a process does not break
// that — \`bands()\` reads getClientRects, \`inkBands\` reads pixels, and neither
// can reach the other. What the merge DOES put at risk is that a future hand
// makes the ink reading derive from the rect reading (cropping to a band, say,
// and then counting inside it) — at which point the second coat becomes a
// mirror. The crop is the row's own box and the count is taken over the WHOLE
// crop for exactly that reason. The failure direction stays the kind one: a
// wrong box crops the wrong pixels and the readings DISAGREE. False red, never
// false green.
//
// THE POPULATION THIS INK CLAIM RESTS ON, STATED AS A BOUNDARY (Vira, #298).
// The reading is measured on **12 cells**: two rows x three rules x two shapes,
// one surface, one state, one Chromium on one Linux box. Every band in those
// crops runs 37-50px — which is exactly the "30-50" the deleted tool declared
// it kept, so on THIS population the 8px floor is genuinely inert, floored and
// unfloored identical. That is a fact about the population, not a licence:
// Vira reproduced a one-scanline, 13-pixel fringe at a crop's top edge on a
// healthy tree with nothing planted, and this tool is scored BY FINDING, so a
// false red is its unit of output. The floor stays.
//
// THE FADE QUESTION IS DISPOSED, AND THE ANSWER IS THE SURFACE'S, NOT THIS
// READER'S. Instrumented at the shutter (Vira): `screenIn` ran at 0 of 12
// captures — the Armoury is an overlay, not an `#app > *` child, so opening it
// fires no `screenIn` at all, and the first shutter lands ~13,620 ms after the
// mount, 56x the 240ms window. NOTE FOR ANYONE WRITING A WAIT: `base.css:273`
// is an ANIMATION, not a transition, so `transitionend` would never fire.
// **This file contains no `getAnimations`, `animationend` or `transitionend`,
// and its `sleep(180)` is a geometry settle by its own comment** — the safety
// is the surface's, and a surface that starts animating would remove it
// without a word here changing.
//
// THE DELETED TOOL'S RECORDED RUNS ARE KEPT, deliberately:
// `tools/results/linebudget-camera/` holds the crops and the transcript where
// the crush cell was watched BOTH WAYS (`false-green-red-before-green-dabd7d9.txt`
// — before: "PASS — the two readings agree at every cell", exit 0; after: 8
// findings, exit 1). That is the observation this file's INK reading is built
// on. Deleting the tool deletes a second home for an assertion; deleting its
// evidence would delete the proof the assertion was ever earned.
