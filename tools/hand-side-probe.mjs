// tools/hand-side-probe.mjs — WHICH SIDE OF THE MODEL IS AN ARMAMENT DRAWN ON?
//
// Constantine, 2026-08-21: "in armory, the right hand and left hand weapons are
// on the wrong side on the character model in all views armory, character
// creation and combat. the sword shows on my right side of the screen, but on
// the left side of the character since it's facing the player."
//
// THE GEOMETRY, so this is checkable rather than arguable. The figure FACES the
// viewer. Facing someone, their right hand is on YOUR LEFT — the same reason a
// mirror is not a photograph. So, with x measured rightward on screen:
//
//     hand === 'right'  ->  ink centroid must be LEFT of the body's centre
//     hand === 'left'   ->  ink centroid must be RIGHT of the body's centre
//
// WHAT IS MEASURED. The producer bakes each full-frame layer at a TYPE-DEFAULT
// socket: shields at LX, everything else at RX. That is not the weapon row's
// `hand` value. `hand` is eligibility; figureSpec() reads the actual slot and
// supplies a per-layer mirror when the piece is moved away from its authored
// socket. ARM 2 exercises every legal slot placement, including BOTH placements
// for `hand=either`, through the same global and per-layer mirrors the player
// receives.
//
// THE READING IS AN ALPHA-WEIGHTED CENTROID, not a bounding box. A bounding box
// is decided by the single most extreme pixel, so one stray anti-aliased texel
// from a crossguard moves the verdict and nothing reports that it did. The
// centroid is carried by the mass of the piece.
//
// THE X ORIGIN IS THE BODY'S OWN INK, never the canvas centre. A figure that
// does not sit centred in its own frame would otherwise read as handed when it
// is only off-centre — and that error looks EXACTLY like the defect being
// hunted, which is the one confusion this probe must not ship.
//
// TWO ARMS, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IS THE GATE.
//   ARM 1 (diagnostic) reads each RAW ASSET once and reports its type-default
//     socket. It REPORTS and never decides the exit code.
//   ARM 2 (the gate) measures THE RENDERED FIGURE through the shipped
//     stylesheet — the pixels a player actually receives, CSS transform and
//     all. This is what must be green, and it is what goes red the moment the
//     correction in styles/ui.css is removed or double-applied.
//
//   node tools/hand-side-probe.mjs            → both arms; exit 1 if ARM 2 is wrong
//   node tools/hand-side-probe.mjs --selftest → both directions planted

    // Armoury mounts it bare; combat nests it inside `.class-sprite`". That
    // stopped being true at #590, when the class figures became paintings:
    // `equippedFigure()` has ONE call site left in the whole app — the Armoury
    // preview, `screens/equipment.js:423` — and it mounts into `.armoury-figure`
    // as `fig || playerSprite(...)`, which is either/or, never nested.

    // "it is just no longer the combat figure".

    // passing only because `.class-sprite` itself carried the mirror, which
    // happened to feed the probe's synthetic wrapper; #618 moved that mirror
    // onto `.class-sprite > .facing` and the wrapper stopped inheriting it. The
    // arm then read 184px and looked like a rendering regression. It was not:
    // the model had been wrong since #590 and #618 merely stopped satisfying it.
    //
    // Re-pointing it at `.armoury-figure` was considered and refused: that
    // element carries no transform, so the comparison would be a shape against
    // itself — a green that measures nothing, which is the one thing the verdict
    // door in this repo exists to refuse.
