// tools/modal-shell-contract.mjs — the shell is the only chrome, and the count
// of surfaces that disagree only ever goes DOWN.
//
// WHAT THIS TOOL PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT.
//   PROVES   that modalShell.js exports one opener; that the button ladder
//            rejects a width it does not have; that a surface which adopts the
//            shell does not ALSO hand-roll a veil, a panel or a dismissal; and
//            that the number of surfaces still carrying their own chrome is at
//            or below the ratchet below.
//   DOES NOT prove behaviour. Escape closing the topmost dialog, focus return,
//            veil-click, the ladder's rendered widths and the uniform body
//            height are DOM facts, and this tool never opens a DOM. Both fake
//            DOMs in this repo (tests/confirmation-modal.test.mjs,
//            tools/flask-menu-cancel.mjs) lack querySelector/querySelectorAll/
//            classList, which openModal uses, so neither can drive it and a
//            third copy is not the answer. That gap is named here rather than
//            papered over with a source check dressed up as a behaviour check;
//            closing it wants a real page (tools/browser.mjs) and is owed.
