// tools/release-shots-selftest.mjs — the known-bad corpus for release-shots.mjs.
//
// Bjorn, 2026-08-15. Vira's doors audit (`docs/TOOL-DOORS-AUDIT.md`) puts
// release-shots in the HARNESS/exempt column — "asserts nothing". That was true
// of the tool it was written about and it is not true of this one: this file
// refuses BEFORE the browser on an unaccounted state, on a blind reader, on an
// empty home and on a stale bundle, and it fails a shot whose landmark never
// resolved. Those are assertions, so they owe a red, and until today they had
// none. *The instrument rule*: a check whose failing case nobody has watched
// fail is `unknown`, not green.
//
// THE DOOR, and it is the whole reason this file is 200 lines instead of 20.
// Every plant is a REAL EDIT TO A COPY OF THE WHOLE REPO — src/, styles/,
// dist/, tools/, content/ — and the tool is then run AS A WHOLE PROGRAM inside
// that copy (`node <copy>/tools/release-shots.mjs`), so it derives its own ROOT
// from its own location and reads the planted files through the same
// readFileSync, the same imports and the same browser a real run uses. Nothing
// is handed to a function. A fixture passed to `appShotStates()` would exercise
// the regex and prove nothing about the run.
//
// SEVEN PLANTS. Five refuse before the browser (cheap, and they are the guards
// that carry most of this tool's claim); two drive the real browser against a
// planted bundle, because a corpus made only of pre-browser plants would leave
// the half that photographs unproven — which is the shape Vira's audit found
// six times on 2026-08-08.
//
//   1  unaccounted state   a ?shot= state the app has and SCREENS does not
//   2  blind reader        Vira's whitespace plant: every comparison reformatted
//   3  partial blindness   three comparisons reformatted, not all
//   4  empty home          settingsCategories() derives zero ids
//   5  stale bundle        src declares a tab the shipped bundle does not carry
//   6  landmark gone       the browser half: a real MISS on a planted bundle
//   7  drive target gone   the DRIVEN half: a shot whose click has nothing to click
//
// WHY 7 EXISTS, AND IT IS AN ADMISSION (Bjorn, 2026-08-16). Plants 0-6 all run
// `--only title` — an UNDRIVEN shot. So when I changed `profile-drawer` to open
// its tab by CLICKING (cc5f6dd's parent, 3b74fd3), this corpus went green over a
// change it could not see: plant 6's red licenses the undriven landmark door and
// is SILENCE about the driven one. Vira planted both halves by hand and watched
// them red; a plant watched once and not written down is an anecdote, so the one
// that plant 6 cannot give — the DRIVE ITSELF failing — is now a standing row.
// The other half she ran (kill the driven shot's landmark) is deliberately NOT
// added: it is plant 6's class at a second address, and a corpus that grows a row
// per shot measures its own length.
//
// And one GREEN control (plant 0): the untouched copy must exit 0, or every red
// below is a red about copying a tree.
//
// Run: node tools/release-shots-selftest.mjs [--no-browser]
// Exit: 0 all plants behaved · 1 any plant misbehaved · 2 the harness could not run
