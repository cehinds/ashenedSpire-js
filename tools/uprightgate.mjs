// CURRENT AFTER #27: 844x340..464 are complete short-wide boards and therefore

// current bounded composition contract.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE DEFECT THIS WAS BUILT ON, AND IT WAS OBSERVED BEFORE ANYTHING WAS FIXED
//
// Bjorn, 2026-08-15, on the preview bundle at 844x390 in combat:
//
//   "END TURN sits at top 395, bottom 419, in a 390 px viewport — entirely below
//    the fold — inside DIV.combat, which is overflow-y: hidden with scrollHeight
//    758 against clientHeight 629. document.scrollHeight == innerHeight == 390.
//    There is not one scrollable ancestor. No swipe, no wheel, no scrollbar
//    reaches it."
//
// AND HIS RULE, WHICH IS THIS FILE'S CENTRAL MECHANIC: `overflow: hidden`
// SCROLLS PROGRAMMATICALLY AND NEVER BY HAND. He nearly filed the button as
// reachable because `scrollIntoView` moved it and a hit-test then found it —
// the page had not moved at all. So this tool NEVER positions its own target.
// It measures the rect where the screen put it, and it decides "reachable" by
// walking for an ancestor a THUMB could scroll: `overflow-y|x` in auto|scroll
// AND real travel. `hidden` is not a scroll path, whatever a script can do to it.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE THREE CLAUSES
//
//   W — THE WALL. On ?shot=combat, where is `.end-turn` and can a THUMB get to
//       it? Four words, and the fourth is the one I nearly got wrong:
//         onscreen    whole inside the viewport
//         scrollable  not whole, but a real scroller (auto|scroll + travel) exists
//         clipped     part of it is on screen and tappable, no scroll path
//         unreachable not one pixel of it is on screen, no scroll path — A WALL
//       Only `unreachable` is a wall. 915x412 puts 17 of END TURN's 24 px on
//       screen and Bjorn's mobilefit reads 25/45 finger positions on it there:
//       calling that a wall would be describing a measurement in a word stronger
//       than the measurement, which is exactly the error he caught in himself.
//       `clipped` is REPORTED AND NOT LEGISLATED — neither required to gate nor
//       forbidden from gating — because drawing a line inside that band would be
//       a threshold fitted by whoever ran the tool last.
//   G — THE GATE. Every WALLED shape has the orientation gate standing; every
//       standing gate covers the viewport, has its words on screen, does not
//       scroll sideways (Law 5), and stands on BOTH surfaces or neither — the
//       gate is global, because gating at the trap instead of at the door is not
//       mercy. And ITS ADVICE IS TRUE: when it says "turn your phone", the tool
//       emulates the turned viewport and requires the wall to be gone there. A
//       gate that tells a desktop player to rotate their monitor is worse than
//       no gate.
//   K — THE WAKE (development.md, *The wake condition*). The gate is a refusal,
//       and a refusal's correct state and its expired state print the same
//       nothing. So something has to check that the refusal STOPS: THE GATE MUST
//       BE ABSENT ON EVERY SHAPE WHERE NOTHING WALLS. A suite that only asserts
//       the refusal re-proves it forever and watches the premise never.
//
//       IT ASKED ABOUT `whole` UNTIL 2026-08-16 AND MARINA RULED THAT WRONG
//       (MR-142): the refusal answers to the WALL. So the trip is still the wide
//       set — all five required controls whole (WHOLE_SET below), which is the
//       cheap question this run already has an answer to — but a trip is now a
//       QUESTION, not a finding, and it is resolved after every shape is read:
//         · the shape walls at ANOTHER TEXT SIZE   -> justified. The wall arrives
//           ~100 px higher at XL than at S and the gate is one number for all four.
//         · nothing walls here, but something walls ABOVE here -> the price of one
//           downward-closed threshold over a wall set with a hole in it. Counted
//           in `--ladder`'s COST table, printed per shape, not a finding.
//         · nothing walls here and nothing walls above -> THE FINDING. The refusal
//           has outlived its premise: `gateBelowH` comes down or
//           components/upright.js is deleted. The day a landscape composition
//           ships, every trip lands here.
//
//       WHY THE TRIP IS STILL `whole` AND NOT THE PREMISE. It is a filter, not the
//       verdict: it is free (already measured), it never misses a dead premise (a
//       shape with no wall anywhere and a gate standing is whole at some text size
//       or it is a layout defect clause W already owns), and it keeps the
//       expensive four-text-size re-read to the handful of shapes that could be
//       findings. The VERDICT reads the wall, every time.
//
// K is the clause that makes this an instrument rather than a victory lap. W and
// G would both stay green under a gate that stands at every shape on earth.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE POPULATION, AND WHO DREW EACH EDGE
//
//   SHAPES — typed, and chosen to contain the DISAGREEMENTS rather than to be
//     long. Two landscape phones (the subject), two portrait phones including
//     the smallest this house tests, the iPad-portrait shape that caused #24,
//     A TABLET IN LANDSCAPE (1024x768 — landscape and perfectly fine, which is
//     the whole reason the predicate is not an orientation), the desktop
//     baseline, and A LADDER ACROSS THE THRESHOLD ITSELF (800x410 .. 800x500,
//     WALKED AT 1 PX ACROSS 460..470 where the constant lives). The ladder is
//     here because the FIRST version of this list had none of it and let a
//     predicate ship that refused a working window; the 1 px band is here
//     because the SECOND version spaced it at 10 px and let the constant sit in
//     the hole, three pixels above the measurement, while this file printed
//     PASS. Same rule, same site, twice: A POPULATION WITH NO CELL EITHER SIDE
//     OF ITS OWN BOUNDARY CANNOT TELL YOU THE BOUNDARY IS WRONG — and a
//     boundary written in integers has to be sampled in integers. Full note at
//     `LADDER_H`. If this file ever gates 1024x768 the check has become an
//     orientation sniffer, and clause K says so.
//   DEVICE OR WINDOW — stated per shape (WINDOWS below), not inferred from the
//     dimensions. It decides touch emulation, and through that the app's
//     `(pointer: coarse)` wording query. Inferring it from `min(w,h) < 700` made
//     an 800x410 browser window emulate a touchscreen and be told to turn its
//     phone.
//   SURFACES — two, named: combat (where the wall is) and title (where the
//     player arrives). Not derived from main.js's ?shot= states, and that is a
//     real boundary rather than an oversight: clause W needs a NAMED required
//     control per surface, and only combat has one written down. Widening the
//     surface set without widening the control set would count screens it never
//     actually checked.
//   TEXT SIZE — one cell (the M default) unless `--text S|M|L|XL`, EXCEPT in
//     clause K's resolution, which re-reads a tripped shape at all four because
//     the question it asks is about the other three. Stated in the boundary
//     rather than left to be found: text size changes content height, so a shape
//     that fits at M can wall at XL. THE CONSTANT IS DECIDED AT XL: the last
//     walled height is 367/394/423/464 across S/M/L/XL, the constant is one past
//     the largest (MR-143), and a default `M` run cannot see it move. `--ladder`
//     is the mode that walks all four and checks the number against them;
//     `--selftest` carries the XL cell that sets it and the Text S cell that
//     shows what it costs, so the check does not depend on which flag a person
//     happened to type.
//   NO TOLERANCE ON REACHABILITY. Half a pixel of slack on the viewport edges
//     for device-pixel rounding, and nothing else. "Mostly on screen" is a
//     button a thumb misses.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// DOOR (the instrument rule's same-door clause, commons/development.md)
//
// The real input is the rendered app in a real browser: the tool navigates to
// the same URLs a player's browser loads, at emulated device metrics, and reads
// rects off the frame the screen actually painted. Nothing is handed to an
// inner function. `--selftest` plants each known-bad AS FILE BYTES in a copied
// real tree — the same files the real defect would ship in — and re-runs this
// whole tool from that copy, so the planted bytes are what boots.
//
// OBSERVED RED, before any fix existed, on the tree at 1ab9777
// (train/preview-2026-08-15 — the bytes Constantine is holding):
//   CHROME=/usr/bin/chromium node tools/uprightgate.mjs   ->  exit 1
//   FAIL — 4 finding(s) over 14 shape(s):
//     844x390 combat + title: WALL: .end-turn lies at top 394.95..419.33
//       outside a 390 px viewport with NO scrollable ancestor (nearest clipper
//       DIV.combat, overflow-y hidden, scrollHeight 758 > clientHeight 629) —
//       and NO GATE STANDS
//     400x400 combat + title: the same, top 407.95..432.33, scrollHeight 779 >
//       clientHeight 645
//   Bjorn measured "top 395, bottom 419 … scrollHeight 758 against clientHeight
//   629" by hand on the same bundle. This instrument reproduces his numbers to
//   two decimals, independently, which is the only reason it is allowed to
//   speak for them.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// KNOWN OPEN — WHAT THE RE-DERIVATION CLOSED, AND THE ONE THING NO HEIGHT CAN.
//
// Measured 2026-08-16 (Sunna) on this branch — dev = aafa3e2 + this branch +
// vira/two-predicates — headless Chromium, source tree, width 800 for the sweeps.
//
// CLOSED, AND BY A RULING RATHER THAN BY LAYOUT WORK. Moving the constant
// 432 -> 465 puts the gate on every wall this house has measured at width 800:
// the Text XL band h 390..450 AND the one-pixel wall at 464 that sits 14 px
// above the top of the interval everyone was counting. `--predicates` was RED at
// e5cb619 with "A WALL WITH NO GATE — text XL, h 432..464" and is GREEN here.
// Marina's XL card is not re-carded — IT CLOSES. A predicate ruling closed a
// layout card, which is the strongest practical argument for MR-142 and neither
// of us could see it from one predicate alone.
//
//   the wall, per text size, at width 800 (`--ladder --ladder-from 360`, 964
//   cells, exhaustive 1 px):
//     text            S     M     L     XL
//     last WALL h   367   394   423   464      -> constant = max+1 = 465
//     all 5 whole   432   495   533   571      <- the COST column, not the number
//
// STILL OPEN, AND IT IS THE PRICE OF THE RULING, NOT A BUG IN IT. One
// downward-closed threshold over four text sizes must refuse heights that wall
// nobody, and `--ladder` counts them on every run rather than leaving them to be
// discovered: at Text S, h 368..464 are refused and NOT ONE of them is a wall —
// 33 of those (432..464) are FULLY WHOLE, a perfect screen refused. At M, 70
// heights; at L, 41. And h 451..463 refuses nobody at any text size, because
// that is the gap the XL wall jumps and a threshold cannot jump with it. THE
// DIRECTION OF THE COST FLIPPED WITH THE PREDICATE: under `whole` it fell on
// large-text players (walls left uncovered); under the wall it falls on
// small-text players (working heights refused). A per-text-size TABLE
// {368, 395, 424, 465} would pay neither — measured, filed, and not installed,
// because the SHAPE of the threshold is a ruling and MR-142 ruled the predicate.
//
// STILL OPEN, AND NO HEIGHT CLOSES IT: at Text XL, 360x640 is walled — END TURN
// at top 659.25..720.91 in a 640 px viewport. A PORTRAIT phone, at the largest
// accessibility text. A threshold that covered it would have to exceed 640,
// refusing every window shorter than that including desktop ones, and neither
// piece of advice this gate can give is even true there (turning 360x640 gives
// 640x360, which is worse). `--text XL` is therefore still RED on this branch,
// with the finding on 360x640 alone instead of on 23 shapes. THE BOARD MUST FIT
// ITSELF at every text size, or `.combat` must offer a real scroll path. Both
// are layout work; neither is a refusal, and a refusal that grew with the
// accessibility setting would take screens away as a player turns it up.
//
// THE COMBAT BOARD DOES NOT FIT ITSELF AT LARGE TEXT, and that is the cause of
// all of it. % of each control on screen, width 800:
//   Text L : the hand is cut below h 533 (68.83% at 464, 47.8% at 420); END TURN
//            is UNREACHABLE at every h <= 423.
//   Text XL: the hand is cut below h 571 (54.19% at 463); END TURN is
//            UNREACHABLE at every h <= 450 and again at 464.
//   Text S : the hand is cut below h 432 — 67.3% at h 390, CLIPPED WITH NO
//            SCROLL PATH, which is the number Marina's ruling left open as mine.
//   Not only short windows — at Text XL, 1024x600 shows 68% of the hand and
//   960x540 shows 66% of END TURN. Identical at 1ab9777: PRE-EXISTING, all of it.
//
// NOTHING SHIPPED SWEEPS THAT CELL, which is why it surfaced only now:
// mobilefit's s/m/l/xl matrix varies UI SIZE, not Text size, and actionreach
// sweeps Text size on the `customize` screen only. Combat x Text size x shape
// had no instrument. Filed to the board rather than fixed here.

// `--predicates` WAS EXPECTED RED ON THIS TREE AND IS NOW GREEN — the paragraph

// gateBelowH is 432, so h 432..450 is a wall with no gate — Marina's card, with
// those coordinates, filed deliberately rather than left inside the phrase 'a
// layout backlog'." THAT CARD IS CLOSED, NOT RE-CARDED (Sunna, 2026-08-16):
// re-deriving the constant against the premise put it at 465, which covers
// 432..450 AND the one-pixel wall at 464 that neither of us could see until she

// THE CORPUS RUNS IN FOUR GROUPS, BECAUSE A CORPUS IS A POPULATION TOO.
//
// doorplant hands the SAME argv to every plant in a group, and these plants do
// not live at the same cell. The gate's own defects show at Text M on the phone
// shapes; THE CONSTANT'S defect shows in a three-pixel window and only at the
// text size that can see the number. Running the whole corpus at one cell would
// make plants report NOT CAUGHT for want of a shape rather than for want of a
// check. So: group 1 is the gate, group 2 is the constant's guard IN THE MAIN
// RUN, group 3 is the derivation, group 4 is the predicate against the premise.
// One number, checked at the cell where it is decided rather than at the cell
// that is convenient.
//
// THE CELLS MOVED WITH THE NUMBER, 2026-08-16. Under `whole` the constant was
// the MINIMUM over the text sizes, so Text S set it and both constant groups
// lived at S in the 430s. Under the premise it is the MAXIMUM (MR-142/MR-143),
// so Text XL sets it at 465 and group 3 derives there; group 2 stays at Text S
// because S is now where the constant's other edge shows — the heights just
// above it that work for everyone. A corpus anchored to a moved number is the
// same defect this branch was opened to fix.
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// THIS CORPUS EXITS 1, AND FIVE OF ITS PLANTS CANNOT BE CAUGHT HERE BY
// CONSTRUCTION. Read this before "fixing" them. (Bjorn, 2026-08-21, #299.)
//
// `--selftest` exited 1 before this pass and exits 1 after it. What changed is
// that its redness is now EXPLAINED instead of silent, which is the whole of
// what this pass could honestly deliver.
//
//   · 4 plants were DRIFTED — their find-strings died when #27 gave the gate an
//     `enabled` term. Re-aimed; all four now CAUGHT by their own named reds.
//   · 1 plant is new (the band contract, below) and is CAUGHT.
//   · 5 plants target the REFUSAL THRESHOLD and are UNCATCHABLE BY THIS TOOL.
//
// WHY, MEASURED — NOT ARGUED. `shortWideMinH` is not merely compared against
// the board; it DECIDES the composition the board renders, so the wall moves
// with it and every value is self-consistent. Same door, same width (800),
// same text size (XL):
//
//     shortWideMinH: 340 (as shipped)  ->  wall h 330..339  ->  max(wall)+1 = 340  PASS
//     shortWideMinH: 335 (planted)     ->  wall h 325..334  ->  max(wall)+1 = 335  PASS
//
// Lower it and the heights just under it stop being refused and start rendering
// the compact composition, so the wall shrinks to meet the new number. Raise it
// and those heights lose the compact composition, genuinely break, and the
// refusal is justified by the very change under test. THE CONSTANT MANUFACTURES
// ITS OWN PREMISE IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.
//
// This is NOT Charter 2b. 2b says a threshold with no cell adjacent to it cannot
// tell you it is wrong, and answers with sample density. Here density is no help
// whatever: there is no value of this constant that this derivation reports as
// wrong, so `--ladder`'s agreement is not evidence about the number. A check
// that cannot fail is decoration, and these five plants are what proves it.
//
// WHERE THE SOUND PREMISE LIVES. `balance.js` says this number is "the compact
// wide composition's rendered lower edge … derived at one-pixel resolution by
// tools/short-landscape-support.mjs before this value is consulted, so moving
// the number without moving the rendered premise goes red." A derivation that
// FORCES the compact composition and finds where its required controls stop
// being whole would not be self-referential. Whether that tool actually does
// this is UNMEASURED BY ME and outside my claimed path (#299) — routed as a
// card, deliberately not chased inside this diff.
//
// DISPOSITION IS A REVIEWER'S CALL, NOT THE MAKER'S. By our own rule a plant
// that provably cannot fail is decoration and should go; deleting five checks
// on the strength of my own measurement is exactly the act a maker does not
// clear for himself. They stay, labelled, until someone else rules.

//
// IT IS HERE BECAUSE MY OWN RULE HAS NOW CAUGHT ME TWICE AT THIS ONE SITE. The
// FIRST version of this list had no ladder at all and let me ship a predicate
// that refused 800x450, a working window. I fixed that with a neighbourhood —
// and then spaced the neighbourhood at 10 px and left `gateBelowH` sitting in
// the hole. At Text S every required control is whole from h 432 up, so
// h 432/433/434 were three screens the gate refused while this tool printed
// PASS 14/14, because it had a cell at 430 and a cell at 440 and nothing
// between. Bjorn found it by hand (2026-08-15) and it is the same sentence a
// second time: A POPULATION WITH NO CELL EITHER SIDE OF ITS OWN BOUNDARY CANNOT
// TELL YOU THE BOUNDARY IS WRONG — and "either side" means EITHER SIDE, at the
// resolution the boundary is written in. A threshold is an integer; so is its
// ladder.
//
// 460..470 is the band the constant lives in, so it is walked at 1 px. Outside
// that band the ladder stays coarse on purpose: those cells prove the gate keeps
// standing well below and keeps quiet well above, and neither claim needs
// resolution. If `gateBelowH` ever moves out of 460..470, THIS BAND MOVES WITH
// IT — the band is anchored to the constant, and a band left behind by a moved
// constant is exactly the defect above (Marina, 2026-08-15: when you move
// anything, ask what was anchored to its old position).
//
// AND IT MOVED, 2026-08-16, FOR EXACTLY THAT REASON. The band was 430..440 while
// the constant was 432. MR-142 changed the predicate the refusal answers to (the
// WALL, not `whole`) and MR-143 changed the derivation (`max(wall h)+1`, not
// `min(good h)`), so the constant went 432 -> 465 — and I moved the band the
// same hour, because the whole reason the old defect survived was a band left
// three pixels behind its own number. 464 IS INSIDE THIS BAND ON PURPOSE: it is
// the one-pixel Text XL wall that sits 14 px above the top of the interval
// everyone was counting (Vira, 2026-08-15), and it is the cell that sets the
// constant.
//
// AND THE BAND IS ONLY DIAGNOSTIC AT THE TEXT SIZE THAT CAN SEE THE NUMBER —
// WHICH IS NOW THE OTHER END OF THE DIAL. Under `whole` the constant was the
// MINIMUM over the text sizes, so Text S set it. Under the premise it is the
// MAXIMUM, so Text XL sets it (S 368, M 395, L 424, XL 465 — `--ladder`), and
// Text S is where its COST is visible instead: at S every one of these rungs is
// a screen that works and is refused anyway. Both readings matter and they are
// different runs. `--selftest` group 2 runs the band at S for the cost edge and
// group 3 derives at XL for the number, rather than trusting anyone to remember.

// `--ladder` — WHERE THE CONSTANT COMES FROM. Derived on demand, not remembered.
//
// `balance.ui.uiScale.gateBelowH` is a MEASUREMENT, and until now it was a
// measurement taken by hand once and typed into a comment. That is a frozen
// snapshot of a thing that moves with the board, and the ladder table beside it
// pointed at `node tools/uprightgate.mjs` as the way to re-take it — a command
// that could not produce that table. A pointer to a re-measure that does not
// re-measure is how 435 survived: the number looked sourced.
//
// ===========================================================================
// WHAT THIS DERIVES, AND IT CHANGED ON 2026-08-16 — TWICE, FOR TWO REASONS
// ===========================================================================
//
// IT USED TO READ `wholeCount` AND NEVER `ctl.reach`. Same probe, same frame,
// second half discarded (MR-144, Vira). So it derived the constant from ALL
// FIVE REQUIRED CONTROLS WHOLE — a QUALITY question, *is this screen good* —
// while the gate exists for a WALL: END TURN not one pixel on glass and no
// gesture to it, a SAFETY question, *can this player continue*.
//
// MARINA RULED THE PREDICATE (MR-142): THE REFUSAL ANSWERS TO THE WALL. Three
// reasons and the third decides it alone — the gate's cost is total, so it
// fires on a total condition; a refusal removes the player's choice while a
// degraded screen leaves it; and `whole` CAN BE SATISFIED BY THE VERY
// INTERACTION THAT STRANDS THE PLAYER (one flask gesture takes 844x390 from
// 2/5 + UNREACHABLE to 5/5 + onscreen — Vira, re-observed). A refusal predicate
// the trap itself satisfies is not conservative, it is the wrong question.
//
// AND THE DERIVATION ITSELF WAS UNSOUND, WHICH IS MINE (MR-143). It took
// `min(good h)` — the FIRST height that works. THE WALL SET IS NOT AN INTERVAL:
// at Text XL the ungated cells are h 432..450 AND 464, with 451..463 not walled
// at all (the auto-zoom steps 0.63 -> 0.64 and the board grows faster than the
// window; END TURN 13.37% at 460, 0% AT 464, 19.76% at 470). "The first h that
// stops being bad" is a monotonic idea and this ground is not monotonic — I
// MEASURED THE NON-MONOTONICITY MYSELF (97.13% at h 485, 94.4% at 486), used it
// to justify sweeping exhaustively, and then derived with `min(good)` anyway.
// THE SOUND DERIVATION IS `max(bad h) + 1`: one past the LAST wall, never the
// first non-wall. It is the only form that survives a hole.
//
//   THE DERIVATION, IN ONE LINE:  gateBelowH = max over the enumerated text
//   sizes of ( last h where `.end-turn` is UNREACHABLE ) + 1.
//
// MAXIMUM, NOT MINIMUM, AND THE DIRECTION FLIPPED WITH THE PREDICATE. Under
// `whole` the binding constraint was "refuse no working screen", so the
// constant was the SMALLEST of the four. Under the premise the binding
// constraint is COVERAGE — a wall the gate does not stand on is a player who
// cannot finish their turn — so it is the LARGEST. One number cannot do both
// jobs at once and this one now does the safety job, which is the ruling.
//
// BOTH EDGES ARE REAL DEFECTS AND BOTH ARE ASSERTED:
//   · a constant AT OR BELOW the last wall leaves a WALL WITH NO GATE — the
//     premise holds and the refusal is absent. That is what 432 was at Text XL.
//   · a constant ABOVE max(wall)+1 refuses heights where the player can reach
//     END TURN — a refusal that has outgrown its premise, which is clause K's
//     defect at the source.
//
// THE COST OF ONE NUMBER IS PRINTED, NOT HIDDEN. A single downward-closed
// threshold over a wall set that differs by text size (and is not even an
// interval) necessarily refuses heights that wall nobody. This mode counts them
// and names the worst of them, per text size, so the price is a number in the
// output rather than a sentence in a comment. It is my cost and I own it
// (MR-142's division: Marina rules what the mechanism is for; I derive the
// number and own the consequences).
//
// EXHAUSTIVE, 1 PX, NO BISECTION, AND NOW OVER THE WHOLE RANGE. Phase B used to
// bracket at 8 px above the constant and close at 1 px — that is exactly the
// hole-shaped assumption above, wearing a cheaper coat, and it is DELETED. Every
// cell from `--ladder-from` to `--ladder-to` is read. The floor of the sweep does
// not affect the derivation (a cell below the maximum cannot raise it); it
// decides only how much of the refused span the COST table can see. The ceiling
// does affect it, so the ceiling is asserted: a sweep whose top cell is still a
// wall has not found the top edge, and that is a finding, not a pass.
//
// THE `whole` COLUMN IS STILL REPORTED — AND NOW IT IS CHECKED THE SAME WAY.
// MR-143's third half: whether 432/495/533/571 were `min(whole)` or
// `max(not-whole)+1` was UNMEASURED, and inheriting a number from a monotonic
// assumption is the same defect at a new address. Both are computed and printed
// side by side, and a disagreement is named with the holes listed.
//
// DOOR. Every measurement comes through the same door as the rest of this file —
// the rendered app in a real browser, read off the frame it painted. The one
// thing not read through the browser is the NUMBER BEING CHECKED: `gateBelowH`
// is read by importing src/content/balance.js in Node. Same bytes, different
// loader, and it is named here rather than left to be found. Whether the shipped
// bundle carries those same bytes is tools/verify-shipped.mjs's subject.

  //
  // This derivation compares a RENDERED wall edge to a written number, so it is
  // only sound if the written number is the one that decides refusals.
  // `main.js:376` computes `short = h < gateBelowH && !compact`, and `compact`
  // holds for any shape at or above `shortWideMinH` whose width still fits, so

  (a) WIDTH IS NOT SWEPT BY DEFAULT. The constant is a HEIGHT and the fit is not
      purely one, so this ran at ${widths.join(',')}. Measured 2026-08-15 (Sunna) at Text S
      under the OLD predicate: 432 at widths 600/800/844/1200/1440 — it SATURATES
      — and later at narrower ones (444 at 400 and 360, 453 at 300, where the
      narrow layout takes over). THAT WAS A \`whole\` MEASUREMENT AND IT DOES NOT
      TRANSFER: the wall's width behaviour is re-derived with --ladder-width, and
      the NARROW layout is a different composition with its own wall (at Text XL,
      360x640 is walled — a portrait phone, far above any height threshold, and
      no height can gate it without refusing every phone. That is layout work.)
  (b) UI SIZE. Every cell here is Auto fit. A player on a fixed UI-size setting
      is a different board, and mobilefit is the tool that sweeps that axis.
  (c) ONE SURFACE. ?shot=combat, because that is where the required control is
      named. A screen that fits combat and not the map is not this number's.
  (d) ONE BOX, headless Chromium, device-metric emulation, and EVERY CELL IS
      READ AS A WINDOW — no touch emulation, the same call the 800x… rungs make
      in the main run. A touchscreen of the same dimensions is a device cell and
      differs in the gate's WORDING, not in whether END TURN is reachable.
  (e) BOOT STATE ONLY, AND THIS IS THE SHARPEST ONE. Every cell is the board as
      it paints, before any interaction. One flask gesture at 844x390 scrolls
      \`.combat\` 162.9 px programmatically and takes END TURN from UNREACHABLE to
      onscreen while carrying the topbar off the top with no gesture back (Vira,
      2026-08-15, re-observing Bjorn). SO A WALL IS A PROPERTY OF THE SHAPE AND A
      SCROLL STATE. This mode derives from the state the player arrives in, which
      is the state the refusal has to decide in. Nothing here measures after an
      interaction, and that silence is a boundary, not a safety.
  (f) THE CLIPPED BAND IS NOT LEGISLATED. \`unreachable\` is the word the premise
      uses; a control 70% on screen with no scroll path is not a wall and is not
      fine either. Widening the refusal to cover it would hide a layout bug
      behind a wall — see THE COST above for what it actually costs a player.`);

// `--predicates` — THE GATE'S PREDICATE AGAINST THE GATE'S PREMISE.
//
// Vira, 2026-08-15, on Marina's question (packet e431613): Sunna's constant is
// derived from ALL FIVE REQUIRED CONTROLS WHOLE; this gate was built for a WALL
// — END TURN unreachable by any gesture. MARINA COULD NOT SETTLE FROM A SUMMARY
// WHETHER THOSE TWO NAME THE SAME SET OF SCREENS, and stopped rather than rule.
// They are different predicates and the whole argument turns on it, so it is a
// measurement and not an opinion. This mode is the measurement.
//
// WHY IT IS HERE AND NOT IN A NEW FILE. Both predicates are already this file's:
// clause W owns the wall, clause K owns the five. The question "are W's set and
// K's set the same set" is a question about THIS TOOL'S OWN TWO CLAUSES, and a
// second file would have meant a second copy of the door — the same browser
// boot, the same probe, the same serve — to ask about the instrument that
// already has one. It reuses read() and probe() untouched. IT CHANGES NOTHING
// ABOUT THE DEFAULT RUN OR `--ladder`: Sunna's derivation and its assertions are
// not forked, not restated and not touched.
//
// WHAT IT ASSERTS, AND IT IS ONE RELATION, NOT A NUMBER (the falsifier that
// fails for the right reason):
//
//   P1 — EVERY WALL IS GATED. At every cell where `.end-turn` is UNREACHABLE,
//        the gate must be STANDING. Not "h < gateBelowH" — that would be this
//        tool keeping a second copy of main.js's decision and then checking its
//        own copy. THE GATE IS READ OFF THE PAINTED FRAME, so what is checked is
//        the refusal the player actually meets.
//
// WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT ASSERT, because the house already owns it:
//   · that no working screen is refused — `--ladder` derives exactly that and is
//     its home (single-home rule); this mode reports the band and rules nothing.
//   · that a gate standing on a 5/5 shape is wrong — clause K, above.
//   · the CLIPPED band. Sunna refused to legislate inside it and she is right:
//     a threshold drawn inside a band nobody measured is fitted by whoever ran
//     the tool last. Widening a refusal to cover a layout defect hides a bug
//     behind a wall.
//
// EXHAUSTIVE, 1 PX, NO BISECTION — Sunna's rule and the reason for it hold here
// unchanged: the fit is NOT monotonic in height (97.13% at h 485, 94.4% at 486,
// the auto-zoom stepping 0.66 -> 0.67), and a boundary search that assumes
// monotonicity is a guess wearing a measurement's clothes. `wallTop` is
// therefore the LARGEST h in the sweep that is a wall, not the first h that
// stops being one — so a wall that reappears above a gap is caught rather than
// stepped over.
//
// UNKNOWN IS NEVER GREEN, TWICE OVER:
//   · a sweep whose TOP CELL IS STILL A WALL has not found the wall's top edge.
//     That is a finding, not a pass — widen --predicate-to.
//   · a text size with NO WALL ANYWHERE in the sweep is REPORTED AS HAVING HAD
//     NOTHING TO RULE ON (SOP 2's ⚙ clause: prove the query had a referent). An
//     empty result and a clean result look identical and mean the opposite.
//
// DOOR: the same one as the rest of this file — the rendered app in a real
// browser at emulated device metrics, read off the frame it painted, nothing
// scrolled or positioned by the probe. The known-bad enters as file bytes in
// `src/content/balance.js` in a copied real tree and the whole tool re-runs from
// that copy (`--selftest`, group 4).

// THE ANSWER, MEASURED. Width 800, ?shot=combat, wide layout, Auto fit, read as
// a window, 1 px exhaustive 360..480 (484 cells) and again 480..600 (484 cells),

//   S      367           390                    432                368..431  (64 px)
//   M      394           420                    495                395..494 (100 px)
//   L      423           451                    533                424..532 (109 px)
//   XL     464           510                    571                465..570 (106 px)
//
//   (the `all 5 whole` column is --ladder's, re-derived here at the same ref and
//   identical: 432/495/533/571, minimum 432, PASS. No wall anywhere in 480..600
//   at any text size, so `last WALL h` is a found edge and not a sweep artefact.)
//
// THEY DO NOT COINCIDE, AT ANY TEXT SIZE, AND THE GAP IS 64 TO 109 PX. Between
// the two columns the screen is NOT a wall and NOT whole: END TURN is on the
// glass, a thumb ends the turn, and the hand is cut. "All five whole" is a
// STRICT SUBSET of "not a wall" — necessarily, since `.end-turn` is one of the
// five — so an argument that holds for one does not transfer to the other.
// Which predicate the refusal should answer to is a ruling and is not here.
//
// THE WALL AT TEXT XL IS NOT AN INTERVAL, AND THIS IS THE PART NOTHING ELSE
// COULD HAVE FOUND. Ungated wall cells at XL: h 432..450 AND h 464 — with
// 451..463 not walled at all. At 464 the auto-zoom steps 0.63 -> 0.64 and the
// board grows faster than the window, so END TURN goes 13.37% on screen at 460,
// to 0% at 464, back to 19.76% at 470. Three runs, identical. IT IS ONE PIXEL
// TALL AND IT SITS 14 PX ABOVE THE TOP OF THE BAND EVERYONE HAS BEEN COUNTING.
// Sunna's rule — a bisection would be a guess in a measurement's clothes — was
// written about the FIT and it has now paid out on the WALL; and note that even
// her exhaustive 1 px ladder could not have found this, because `--ladder` reads
// `wholeCount` and never once reads `ctl.reach`. Same probe, same call, the
// second half discarded.
//

      and is not restated here.

      makes. Touch changes the gate's WORDING, not whether the board fits.

      measures that the two sets differ and where. Which one the refusal should
      answer to is a ruling, and rulings are not numbers.
  (e) IT DOES NOT TAP, AND THAT IS THIS MODE'S SHARPEST LIMIT — every cell above
      is the board at boot. Bjorn's flask finding, RE-OBSERVED by Vira at e5cb619
      rather than inherited (SOP 2's drift clause), 844x390 Text M, one real
      pointer gesture dispatched at the flask:
        before  .end-turn top 394.95..419.33, 0% on screen, UNREACHABLE,
                whole 2/5, \`.combat\` scrollTop 0, scrollH 758, clientH 629,
                overflow-y hidden, topbar top 0, gate STANDING
        after   .end-turn top 293.95..318.33, 100% on screen, ONSCREEN,
                WHOLE 5/5, \`.combat\` scrollTop 162.9, scrollH 792,
                topbar top -101, scroller STILL null
      Text S, same shape: 3/5 -> 5/5, scrollTop 0 -> 103.23, topbar to -64.
      SO "WHOLE" IS NOT A PROPERTY OF THE SHAPE. It is a property of the shape
      AND a scroll state, and the only motion that puts END TURN on the glass is
      the one that carries the topbar and its menu off it with no gesture back.
      THE CONSEQUENCE IS CLAUSE K'S, NOT THIS MODE'S: clause K's predicate is
      \`wholeCount === wholeTotal\`, so it reads 5/5 on 844x390 — the shape this
      gate was built for — in a state a player can enter and not leave. Nothing
      today measures after an interaction, so nothing fires; that is the reason
      it is silent, and it is not a reason it is safe. Filed, not fixed:
      widening clause K is Sunna's call on Sunna's clause.
      ANSWERED 2026-08-16 (Sunna), and not by widening the set. Clause K still
      TRIPS on \`wholeCount === wholeTotal\` — it is free and it never misses a
      dead premise — but A TRIP IS NO LONGER A VERDICT: the verdict re-reads the
      shape at all four text sizes and asks whether ANYTHING WALLS there. So a
      5/5 reading on 844x390, however it was arrived at, can no longer call that
      shape working on its own; the wall at Text M/L/XL answers first. The
      post-interaction state is still unmeasured and still a boundary — what
      changed is that it is no longer the thing deciding.`);

  //      Each tripped shape is therefore re-read at all four text sizes — cheap,
  //      because only shapes that would have been findings are re-read at all.
  //   2. THE PRICE OF ONE NUMBER. `gateBelowH` is a single downward-closed
  //      threshold and the wall set is neither single nor contiguous (Text XL
  //      walls at 432..450 AND 464 — Vira, 2026-08-15). Covering the top of the
  //      wall covers every height beneath it, including heights that wall
  //      nobody. That is counted in `--ladder`'s COST table and it is not a
  //      finding here; it is the consequence of the ruling, which is mine to own.
  //   3. THE REFUSAL OUTLIVING ITS PREMISE — the gate stands where nothing walls
  //      at any text size AND nothing at or above this height walls either. That
  //      is the wake red, and it is the only one of the three that is a finding.

      that shrinks the LAYOUT viewport when the keyboard opens could raise it over
      a text field in portrait. Untested here and untestable here.
  (b) TEXT SIZE — this run measured ${textKey} only. Content height moves with the
      setting, so a shape that fits at M can wall at XL. \`--text XL\` is the other
      cell and it is not run by default.
  (c) SURFACES BEYOND THE DECLARED LIST. Clause W still reads combat and only
      combat; clause R covers every OTHER surface that declares a required
      control, and today that is the Smith's confirm panel. A screen with no
      entry in that list is still unmeasured, and the list is the honest
      statement of coverage: combat, rest-smith, title. The map at 844x390 is a maze rather than a
      wall (Bjorn: the ENTRANCE—BOSS strip is display:none above 700 px, 1074 px of
      the choice off screen) and the gate covers it by standing everywhere — but
      this tool names no required control there and therefore proves nothing there.
  (d) WHETHER THE REFUSAL IS THE RIGHT CALL. It measures that the game says no and
      says it legibly. Whether landscape should instead be SUPPORTED is a design
      decision (it was taken: components/upright.js, header) and no number here.
  (e) THE ROUNDING BAND. The predicate is the zoom CLAMP, not the fit, so shapes
      within the zoom-rounding quantum (~6 local px at the floor) can be clipped
