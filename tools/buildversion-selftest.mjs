// tools/buildversion-selftest.mjs — the known-bad corpus for the version check.
//
// SOP 5 does not ask for a detector. It asks for "a detector plus a known-bad
// corpus, never a checklist … it must FAIL on a fixture that re-types the
// version, or it proves nothing". Until this file ran, `--check` was `unknown`,
// not green, whatever it printed (development.md, *The instrument rule*).
//
// ── THE DOOR, STATED, BECAUSE THE DOOR NAMED IS THE EXTENT OF THE GREEN ──────
//
// Every plant below is a REAL EDIT TO A REAL FILE IN A REAL SOURCE TREE — a
// byte-for-byte copy of index.html, styles/, src/, assets/ and the committed
// bundle — and the tool is then entered at `check(root)`, the same entry point
// the live run uses. Nothing is handed to a predicate downstream of the sweep:
// each plant goes through the directory walk, the reader, the canonicalizer and
// the row's own test, exactly as a real defect would. The clause that demands
// this is development.md's same-door amendment; the reason it exists is that
// six sincere greens in this house were bought by fixtures that entered below
// the defect they were written to catch.
//
// WHAT THAT DOOR DOES *NOT* LICENSE, and it is the newer half of the clause:
// this says the check fires on a defect PRESENT IN THE FILES IT READS. It says
// nothing about a defect that never reaches those files — a version invented in
// a browser at runtime, a stamp painted by CSS. Those are ink, and ink is
// tools/buildstamp-shot.mjs with a browser and its own corpus.
//
// A NEGATIVE CONTROL RUNS FIRST, because a check that is red on a clean tree
// catches every plant and means nothing. What the control is USED for changed
// on 2026-08-16 and the next paragraph is the whole of it — it is recorded and
// compared against, no longer a veto.
//
// THE CONTROL IS RECORDED PER ROW, NOT USED AS A WHOLE-TREE VETO, AND THAT
// CHANGED ON 2026-08-16. It used to refuse the entire run if any row was
// non-green. That was right while a non-green control could only mean a broken
// check — but row B can now resolve to UNKNOWN on a tree whose defect is REAL,
// KNOWN and OPEN (the About screen and the build stamp render two different
// numbers; Constantine's call, carried by Marina). A whole-tree refusal would
// have let one honest open question silently disable the corpus for all five
// rows, which is a checklist outcome: the suite stops ruling and says so in a
// way nobody reads.
//
// SO EACH PLANT MUST MOVE ITS OWN ROW, AND THAT IS A STRICTLY STRONGER BAR THAN
// THE ONE IT REPLACES. Two things are demanded of every plant, not one:
//
//   1. the asserted row ends RED — not merely non-green. A plant that only
//      manages to push a row to UNKNOWN has not been caught; unknown is never
//      green and it is never evidence of a catch either.
//   2. the asserted row's DETAIL DIFFERS from the control's detail for that
//      same row. This is the new half. It proves THIS edit moved THIS row,
//      rather than the plant inheriting a verdict it did not earn from a row
//      that was already unhappy before it was planted.
//
// Clause 2 is what keeps an already-non-green row plantable at all, and row B
// is the reason it had to exist. A hit on any other row is still surfaced.
//

// repository with a real merge in it and enters at `whichCommits()` — the same
// function the CLI calls, over a real `git log`, on a real `.gitattributes`.
//
// WHAT IT PLANTS is the shape that was live on `dev` at `a05d071`: a bundle
// RE-DERIVED INSIDE THE MERGE ACT, so the merge commit's artifact differs from
// BOTH parents. `git log -S` does not diff merges at all by default, so the
// pickaxe walked straight past the commit that shipped the build. Case T1 runs
// the OLD command as well as the new one and requires the old one to be SILENT —
// the observed red, without which the fix is its author's opinion.
//
// T2 is the other edge and it is the one a fix could easily buy the first with:
// making merges visible also makes REMOVALS visible, and the caller's question is
// "which commit shipped this", not "when did this string move". A digest replaced
// by a merge must report the commit that shipped it and NOT the merge that
// stopped shipping it.

// stderr is PIPED, not inherited: `git merge --no-commit` reports success on
// stderr, and a corpus that prints git's chatter between its own verdicts is a
