//
// Constantine, 2026-08-15: "the statte descriptions kind of suck. perhaps have
// a simplifed verison with just the starting stats, starting armaments
// selection , and then have the ability to expand by clicking, with tool tips.
// for character creation I mean"
//
// WHAT THIS ASKS, and it is one question in seven parts (seven since
// 2026-08-16, when Constantine found on the shipped build the thing none of
// the other six ask — see 7):
//   1. IS THE ARRIVAL SHORT — every entry the CONTENT TABLES call face-tier is
//      drawn, every entry they call reveal-tier is NOT, no reveal is open, and
//      no face carries prose (a face's text must be exactly its own label and
//      its own number — anything else is the paragraph coming back).
//   2. DOES A TAP EXPAND — clicking a face opens ITS reveal, the reveal says
//      that entry's authored sentence, and tapping again closes it.
//   3. IS THE KNOB LIVE — the expander shows exactly the entries the table put
//      behind it, and its count is the table's count. THIS IS THE ONE THAT
//      MATTERS: a screen with a hard-coded list of "simple" stats passes 1 and
//      2 and fails here, which is why the first plant below is exactly that.
//   4. CAN A THUMB HIT IT — every face and every armament tile at or above the
//      44 device px floor, measured on the rendered rect (Law 4 clause 4).
//   5. DOES IT SCROLL SIDEWAYS — horizontal travel per SCROLL CONTAINER on the
//      creation screen is ZERO at 390x844 (Law 5 clause 1, measured per
//      container because a document-level reading is 0 by construction here).
//   6. IS THE PICKER FOLDED, AND DOES IT STILL SAY WHAT IS CHOSEN — added
//      2026-08-16 (Sunna) for MR-151, Constantine's "go ahead and allow the
//      fold", narrowed to three rows the same day by MR-171 (KEEPSAKE came back
//      out) and to ONE — TINT — by MR-189 (SIGIL and SPRITE came out after it;
//      see the roster below). That row folds by the SAME affordance: on arrival
//      it is a face and nothing else, its panel shut and its options
//      OFF THE GLASS (counted as CLIENT RECTS, not as an attribute — a
//      predicate about the DOM is not a claim about ink, which is Vira's
//      2026-08-15 finding against an instrument of mine); the face carries THE
//      CURRENT CHOICE IN PLAYER WORDS — ITS LABEL AND ITS VALUE, each a rect
//      WITH AREA, on arrival, and the value again AFTER THE PICK. Every clause
//      of that sentence has now been caught lying, in three findings one commit
//      apart in one file. MR-237: the value was read as `textContent` alone, so
//      a stylesheet could delete the only name of the chosen colour from the
//      screen and this tool still printed it. MR-260, twelve lines below the
//      line that fixed it: the post-pick half kept the `textContent` read after
//      the arrival half moved, and the fixed arrival half counted BOXES, so
//      `font-size: 0` — a box of no size — printed PASS on a blank face. MR-260
//      again, one plant later and mine to have found: the LABEL was never
//      measured at all, and a face reading `Goldbough gold` with no word for
//      what it is OF passed everything here. A RECT IS NOT INK EITHER; the run's
//      own BOUNDARY says what this measure still cannot see, and that paragraph
//      is now written from the predicate rather than around it. A tap opens the
//      row, its options land ON THE GLASS WITH AREA, and picking inside it
//      MOVES THE FACE'S VALUE. Both edges: the named row folds, and NO OTHER
//      row of `.cz-fields` does — folding CLASS, STARTING KIT or KEEPSAKE would
//      hide the choosing behind a choice, and folding SIGIL or SPRITE would buy
//      nothing in words at the price of a tap. Both are red here.
//   7. DOES THE PANEL OPEN UNDER THE FACE THAT WAS TAPPED — added 2026-08-16
//      (MR-287) for the defect CONSTANTINE FOUND HIMSELF, on the build, at
//      334fd02: "in character creation, I would slect an item and instead of
//      expanding under the ubtton it shows up at hte bottom for all of them as
//      if I expanded the bottom button". NOT A FALSE GREEN — AN UNASKED
//      QUESTION, and that is the whole reason it is written down. Every other
//      measure in this file is a y-coordinate or a client rect and NOT ONE of
//      them asks WHERE the panel opened: shut on arrival, the face names the
//      value, the options come on the glass with area — a panel that opens at
//      the bottom of the screen satisfies every one of them. THE CODE IS ALSO
//      CORRECT: disclosure.js builds `.disc-faces` and ONE `.disc-reveal` as
//      its next sibling, and ui.css says "ONE panel, under the row" three
//      lines above `.disc-faces { flex-wrap: wrap }`, so a face on the first
//      of two wrapped rows gets its panel below BOTH. It is a specification
//      the player disagrees with, and nobody would have found it by reading
//      the code (Marina, MR-287). SCOPE — WIDENED 2026-08-17 (MR-301) FROM ONE
//      ROW TO EVERY FACE ON THE SCREEN, and the conditional it replaces is
//      gone rather than amended. Marina scoped this to `FOLDED` because the
//      rest of the screen INHERITED the defect from 334fd02 and a lane that
//      inherits a defect is not the lane that owes it — right when written,
//      and its premise DIED at 50ebb39, where Sunna anchored both brief hosts
//      and took the ungated count to 0/13 at both shapes. A conditional whose
//      premise has died is an excuse outliving its defect, and this one cost
//      exactly what that always costs: Bjorn reverted ONE line of
//      `src/ui/components/disclosure.js` — `insertBefore` -> `appendChild`,
//      the literal pre-fix placement — and the screen went 8/13 and 11/13
//      adrift while this tool printed PASS and EXIT 0. The gated row survived
//      because `.cz-fields` holds ONE face and one face cannot wrap. SO THE
//      GATE IS NOW THE WHOLE SCREEN: every `.disc-face` of every `.cz-disc`,
//      which today is `.cz-fields`' fold row plus `#cz-brief-stats` and
//      `#cz-brief-armaments`, the two hosts Sunna fixed. It is a set, not a
//      list of hosts: a fourth `.cz-disc` is gated the day it mounts. Still no
//      baseline constant and still none typed — the reference length is the
//      layout's own row-gap, read per host. The plant is P17 (Bjorn's revert)
//      and it is red at both shapes; P15 and P16 carry the two edges of the
//      set, first row and last, on both arms of the predicate.
//      WIDENED AGAIN 2026-08-17 (MR-303) FROM ONE COMPOSITION TO FOUR, and
//      the finding behind it is Bjorn's, not mine: gating MR-301 he measured
//      that this pass read whatever state the run left it in, that the state
//      it left was ALWAYS the arrival composition — section 6's pick calls
//      renderPortrait(), which remounts both brief hosts and shuts the
//      expander — and that the count `14` therefore meant 9+4+1 on a clean run
//      and 10+4+0 under P8. TWO DIFFERENT SCREENS READING AS ONE NUMBER, and
//      the expanded one — the state the renderer's own comment says RE-WRAPS
//      THE HOST, which is the state a placement regression shows in worst —
//      was never measured at all. The pass now DRIVES every expander by
//      CLICKING it and measures four compositions: collapsed, expanded, and
//      the two transitions where the panel is already open while the expander
//      moves under it. AND THE COMPOSITION IS CHECKED AGAINST THE CONTENT
//      DOOR — every key the tables name must be measured in the state that
//      holds it — which is what makes a count unambiguous and is also the
//      floor the PARTIAL HOST LOSS never had (Bjorn's second finding at
//      5597166: four faces of a host Sunna fixed left the gate at exit 0).
//      P18 is the expanded state's own plant, red ONLY there; P19 is the
//      partial loss, red only on the key floor.
//
// DOOR — stated here and printed in the run's own output (the instrument
// rule's same-door clause, commons/development.md). THE EXPECTATION and THE
// OBSERVATION enter by two different real roads and are compared:
//   expectation  the content tables under --root are IMPORTED the way the game
//                imports them (src/content/index.js -> createRegistries ->
//                createRunState -> creationBrief). A bad row is refused here by
//                the real content door, by name, exactly as at boot.
//   observation  the app is SERVED over http and booted in headless Chromium
//                at ?shot=customize — the real index.html, the real module
//                graph, the real stylesheet, the real mount — and the faces are
//                CLICKED, not simulated. Nothing is handed to a function.
// --selftest plants each known-bad as FILE BYTES in a disposable copy of this
// tree and re-runs this whole tool at --root COPY, so every plant travels both
// roads.

// THE FOLDED ROSTER — THE WHOLE COLUMN SINCE E4 / #249 (2026-08-21), which
// SUPERSEDES MR-151's one-row scope and the narrowings of MR-170/171/189.
// This is a CONTRACT, so it is written down rather than derived: Constantine
// asked for it ("all the options to be panel buttons... once selected... the
// next section auto opens", 2026-08-15, verbatim on the board card), Marina
// dealt it (family f30e1ca), and a roster read off the screen would move with
// the screen and assert nothing. It is checked in BOTH directions — a named
// row that stopped folding is red, and a row that started folding without
// being named is red.
//
// MR-189'S REASONS MOVE RATHER THAN DIE, and the move is the design record
// (the long form lives at customize.js, "THE FOLD, NOW THE WHOLE COLUMN"):
// MR-189 judged each fold on what its face buys in words ON A STACKED SCREEN,
// where every other row sat open beside it. E4 replaces the stacked screen
// with a TURN-TAKING one — each section auto-opens AT ITS TURN, so a folded
// row is scheduled rather than hidden, and after its turn its face is the
// RECEIPT of the pick in words. `arrives` is part of the contract: CLASS is
// open on arrival — "the top menu (class) should be expanded", his words —
// and every other section waits shut. `box` scopes each row's options to its
// own adopted picker, because six live pickers now share the ONE panel and an
// unscoped `.cz-opt` would count a neighbour's swatches as this row's.
//
// THIS ARRAY IS THE SECOND HALF OF THE REFOLD, and it is what makes his veto
// cheap: change any `pick:*` in customize.js without changing it here and the
// rows below go red BY NAME, in both directions.

// ONE HOME FOR THE MEASURE (MR-260). This string is interpolated into BOTH
// in-page reads below — the arrival read and the post-pick probe — because the
// defect it repairs was two homes: the arrival half was moved to rects on
// 2026-08-16 and the post-pick half, twelve lines away, kept reading
// `textContent`, so one sentence's two halves disagreed about what "on the
// glass" meant while both printed PASS.
//
// A BOX IS NOT AN AREA, and this is the correction Vira's plants forced.
// `getClientRects().length > 0` counts BOXES: an inline span at `font-size: 0`,
// an element at `transform: scale(0)`, and `position:absolute; width:0;
// height:0; overflow:hidden` all still HAVE a box — three ordinary stylesheet
// edits that take the name of the chosen colour off the screen and printed
// `PASS ... ON THE GLASS` at 5fc7a17, watched by hand through the CSS door.
// So the measure asks the rects for their SIZE, which is the thing they carry
// and the thing the old predicate threw away. It is not a wider claim than
// rects support — see the boundary, which still names what ink this cannot see.

// THE ANCHOR (MR-287) — ONE MEASUREMENT, and it is the one nobody asked.
// Constantine found this on the build at 334fd02 himself; the header's part 7
// says why it was invisible to every other line in this file and why the code
// is correct. This is the predicate.
//
// A PANEL IS UNDER ITS OWN FACE IF THE SPACE BETWEEN THEM IS NO MORE THAN THE
// SPACE THIS LAYOUT PUTS BETWEEN TWO OF ITS OWN ROWS. That reference length is
// READ — `getComputedStyle(.disc-faces).rowGap`, the stylesheet's own number,
// plus ONE PIXEL for subpixel rounding (the anchored gap measures 5.39 px
// against a 6 px row-gap at 390x844). A typed tolerance here would be the
// second copy this house exists to catch, and one read off the layout moves
// when the layout moves. The separation is not marginal: anchored reads 5-6 px
// at both shapes, adrift reads 55, 104 and 154 px.
//
// WHY NOT "no other face lies between them", which is the sentence a player
// would say: because it is silent on a one-face host. `.cz-fields` holds
// exactly one folded row, so a stylesheet that pinned the panel to the bottom
// of the viewport would have no face to put between and would pass. The gap
// against the layout's own row-gap catches that, the wrapped-row case, and a
// panel that opens ABOVE its face. The intervening faces are still NAMED in
// the output, because that is the sentence that tells a reader what went
// wrong; they are not what the predicate turns on.
//
// WHAT PASSING LICENSES, stated before it ships (identity card): the panel
// BEGINS within one row-gap below the face that was tapped. It licenses
// nothing about the panel's height, nothing about whether either is in the
// viewport, and nothing about scroll — a panel correctly anchored to a face
// 900 px down the page is still a panel a player must scroll to find, and that
// is MR-172's debt, not this measure's claim.
//
// FOUR STATES, NOT ONE (MR-303, 2026-08-17) — AND THE PASS NOW SETS THE STATE
// RATHER THAN INHERITING IT. Until this commit the anchor read "the screen as
// this run left it", which is two defects wearing one number:
//
//   1. THE EXPANDED COMPOSITION WAS NEVER MEASURED. Section 3 opens the
//      expander; section 6 PICKS a tint; a pick calls renderPortrait(), which
//      re-runs mountDisclosure() on both brief hosts (customize.js:145-146) —
//      a full remount that shuts it again. So \`derived:stamina\`, a face a
//      player reaches in one tap, was never anchor-measured on a clean run
//      (Bjorn, gating MR-301). And the expanded composition is the one the
//      renderer's own comment says RE-WRAPS THE HOST, which is the state a
//      placement regression shows in worst: measured here, at 390x844,
//      expanding moves \`.disc-more\` off the derived row ONTO A LINE OF ITS
//      OWN — a line that exists in no other state.
//   2. THE NUMBER WAS AMBIGUOUS. A clean run read \`14\` as 9 + 4 + 1; under
//      P8 there is no fold, so no pick, so no remount, and the SAME LINE read
//      \`14\` as 10 + 4 + 0. Two different screens, one number, and nobody
//      could tell them apart from the output. A count that reads the same for
//      two compositions is a green that cannot be trusted.
//
// So the pass DRIVES the expander instead of reading whatever earlier sections
// left, and it does it by CLICKING the control a player clicks. Four states:
//
//   collapsed         every expander shut  — the arrival composition
//   expanded          every expander open  — the composition a tap reaches
//   after expanding   the panel is opened FIRST and the expander opened UNDER
//                     IT. This is the player's own path and the only one that
//                     exercises \`if (openKey) open(openKey)\` — the line the
//                     renderer added because "the expander re-wraps the host,
//                     so an open panel's line is no longer the line it was
//                     placed for".
//   after collapsing  the same, in the other direction. A face the collapse
//                     REMOVES is skipped, not failed: that is the expander
//                     doing its job.
//
// NARROWED 2026-08-17 by Bjorn, gating MR-303. THE TWO TRANSITIONS ASK FOR A
// STATE AND NEVER CHECK THEY GOT IT. \`across\` calls \`setMore\` twice per
// reading and reads neither return, so the name on the row is an intention,
// not an observation. The standing pair has a floor for exactly this
// (\`expanderOk\`, below); \`across\` has none. Measured, same door, one file
// edit to the shipped renderer: guard the expander's own click with
// \`if (openKey) return\` — the plausible mis-fix for the re-wrap the comment
// three lines up names — and every toggle inside a transition is refused.
// \`after expanding\` then reads a COLLAPSED screen and \`after collapsing\` an
// EXPANDED one, both correctly anchored, and the run prints
//   PASS ... 48/48 anchored in 4 state(s): collapsed 14/14 · expanded 15/15
//        · after expanding 9/9 · after collapsing 10/10          EXIT 0
// on a build whose expander is dead whenever a panel is open. NOTE THE 48. The
// two transitions contribute 18 readings whose count is read off the DOM with
// no door behind it, so the denominator moved by one and no sentence said so —
// which is \`14\` meaning two screens, at the new size, in the two states this
// commit added. NAMED, NOT CLOSED: the floor is a predicate change and it is
// Vira's file.
//
// AND THE COMPOSITION IS CHECKED AGAINST THE CONTENT DOOR, NOT COUNTED (the
// second assertion below). Every key the tables name must appear in the state
// that holds it. That is what kills the two 14s — a missing entry is named
// instead of shrinking a denominator — and it is also the floor the PARTIAL
// HOST LOSS never had: Bjorn reclassed \`#cz-brief-armaments\` off \`.cz-disc\`
// at 5597166 and this tool printed PASS, 10/10 across 2 hosts, exit 0, with
// four faces of a host Sunna fixed gone in silence. A count cannot see that; a
// named key set can, and it costs no new door.
// SCOPED 2026-08-17 by Bjorn: the key floor runs over \`collapsed\` and
// \`expanded\` ONLY — its own output says so, and this comment did not. THE TWO
// TRANSITIONS HAVE NO KEY FLOOR, so their 18 readings keep the property the
// standing pair just lost: a reading that vanishes shrinks a denominator
// instead of printing a name.

  // MEASUREMENT, because the predicate has TWO EDGES and this house checks
  // both: the panel may drift too far BELOW its face (P15) or land ABOVE it
  // (P16). One plant would have watched one arm and left the other `unknown`.
  //
  // AND A THIRD ROAD, WATCHED BY HAND AT THIS REF AND NOT IN THE CORPUS:
  // `.cz-disc { display: flex; flex-direction: column-reverse }` puts the panel
  // above the face at -96.37 px and goes red by name. It is the same arm as
  // P16 by another road, so it earns a sentence, not a minute of runtime.
  //
  // A NOTE ON P15's SITE, because it cost me a green: the first place I aimed
  // it was a new `.disc-reveal { margin-top: 12rem }` rule appended after
  // `.disc-more`. It landed in the file, the file parsed, and the run came
  // back EXIT 0 GREEN with the gap unchanged at 5.39 px — the ORIGINAL
  // `.disc-reveal` block is 4 lines FURTHER DOWN the stylesheet, equal
  // specificity, and later wins. A plant that lands and does nothing looks
  // exactly like a check that caught nothing to catch. It is edited into the
  // existing declaration now, and the gap it produces is printed, so the
  // plant's own referent is visible in the output rather than assumed.
  //
  // RE-AIMED 2026-08-16 (Bjorn, gating this commit onto dev at 50ebb39) — SAME
  // SITE, NEW TEXT, AND THE SITE IS THE POINT. Sunna's fix DELETED
  // `margin-top: 0.6rem` from this declaration deliberately: the separation is
  // now the container's own `row-gap`, and a margin here would be a second copy
  // of that number (her comment above the rule says so). So P15's `from` string
  // stopped existing and --selftest called it — HARD RED, exit 2, `P15 found NO
  // home in styles/ui.css`. That is Vira's clause doing its job on the first
  // source change after it was written, twice in two commits now (P6 first).
  // The plant still edits the DECLARATION ITSELF, which is the half of Vira's
  // note that must not be lost to a re-aim.
  //
  // AND THE NUMBER MOVED WITH THE SITE: 108 px -> 113.39 px. It is not a
  // re-typed tolerance, it is arithmetic that changed shape. Before, the 12rem
  // REPLACED a 0.6rem margin, so the whole gap was the margin. Now the panel is
  // a row of the wrap, so the gap is the container's `row-gap` (5.39 px) PLUS
  // the planted margin (108 px). Observed, not predicted; had I kept 108 the
  // plant would still have gone red and `mustRed` would have failed it, which

  // chose is the honest one.
  //
  // WHY THIS LINE AND NOT A NO-OP. Sunna's first plant replaced the body of
  // `placeUnderRow` with nothing, which reads like coverage and is not: a no-op
  // leaves the panel as `.disc-faces`' FIRST child, so it opens ABOVE the faces
  // on every host including the fold, 13/13 adrift, and the gated row craters
  // with the rest. It reddens a gate that can already see one row. The
  // one-line revert `insertBefore(panel, next || null)` -> `appendChild(panel)`
  // is literally the pre-fix placement — the panel goes last, under the whole
  // wrapped row instead of under the tapped face — and it is exactly the edit a
  // future hand makes by accident while tidying. THAT is the regression this
  // gate exists to catch, and before the widening it printed EXIT 0.
  //
  // ITS TWO SILENCES, NAMED RATHER THAN LEFT FOR A READER TO FIND. This plant
  // CANNOT redden the first row of the screen or the last, and neither is a
  // gap in the gate:
  //   `pick:tint` (first)  the fold host holds ONE face, and one face cannot
  //     wrap, so `next` is undefined and `insertBefore(panel, null)` and
  //     `appendChild(panel)` are the same call. This is precisely why the old
  //     one-row gate could not see the defect.
  //   `relic:forsakenMedallion` (last)  appending puts the panel directly after

  // WHY THIS EDIT. `placeUnderRow` asks which sibling starts a LATER LINE, and
  // `.disc-more` is one of the siblings it asks about. This tool excludes the
  // expander from the FACES — it is not an entry and has no panel — and the
  // exclusion is one line above the one that must NOT copy it. A hand tidying
  // this file mirrors the filter into `kin` in good faith, and the screen goes
  // on looking right everywhere except in the one composition where the
  // expander sits on a line of its own.
  //
  // AND THAT COMPOSITION EXISTS ONLY WHEN EXPANDED, AND ONLY ON A PHONE.
  // Measured here, 390x844: collapsed, `.disc-more` shares the derived row
  // (`derived:hp, mana, energy, draw, +1 more`), so it is never the sibling
  // that starts a later line and dropping it changes nothing. Expanded,
  // `derived:stamina` takes the fifth slot and `+1 more` wraps ALONE onto a
  // third line — so for every face of the derived row the expander IS the

  //     at 12-way concurrency, against 0/8 clean for the shape this replaces.
  //   * `catch { /* tmp */ }` swallowed a partial removal. The launcher's
  //     verdict is the POSTCONDITION and a failure prints BY NAME.
  //   * Every early exit after the mkdtemp leaked the whole profile — no
  //     try/finally, no exit handler. The launcher registers the profile before
  //     it spawns and sweeps it on exit, SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP and SIGQUIT,
