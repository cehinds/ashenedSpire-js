// tools/surfaces.mjs — is every navigable surface DECLARED IN DATA also HANDLED?
//
// EldenSpire#78. Bjorn found the same defect three times in shipped code while
// looking for something else: vocabulary in data, handler in code, nothing
// checking they agree. A new armoury view rendered as hybrid. A new overlay tab
// showed an empty panel. A new settings category was a lone heading. None of the
// three errored, and that is the whole finding — the author did the data-driven
// thing correctly and got a broken screen in silence (Law 0 clause 5).
//
// WHAT IT ASSERTS, over every row of src/ui/surfaces.js:
//   S0  EVERY HOME CAN BE READ AT ALL — the read is attempted, never trusted, and
//       a home that throws or hands back something that is not a list is a
//       FINDING NAMING THAT HOME, not an exception. S1 counts members; a home
//       that cannot be read never produces one, and on the boot path that was a
//       blank page in the shipped bundle (Vira's P12)
//   S1  EVERY HOME OF THE SET declares at least one member — ZERO IS NOT FULL
//       COVERAGE, it is a home the reader can no longer read (Bjorn's
//       `views = []` red). Per home, not per set: a set with two homes and one
//       guard can lose a whole home and still report coverage (Vira's P8)
//   S2  every member is a name, and no name is declared twice WITHIN ONE HOME —
//       across homes a repeat is the two homes agreeing, which is the point
//   S3  every member RESOLVES to a handler, and the failure names the member
//       and the file to fix
//
// It opens no browser and needs none: this is a join between two lists in the
// source, and the point of the join is that it happens BEFORE anything renders.
// What it therefore cannot tell you is whether the handler it found draws
// anything — that is Bjorn's release-shots, downstream, and both are wanted.
//
// KNOWN-BAD FIRST (development.md SOP 3). `--selftest` plants each breakage in
// memory and prints what went red. A detector that has never been red is not
// evidence. The corpus also carries the breakages this check does NOT yet catch,
// marked OPEN below, so the gap is a failing line rather than a paragraph in a
// review — a finding with no red is a sentence. `--selftest` is therefore RED
// while any of them stands, which is the honest state of the check.
//
// VIKI, folding the gate of 5c49fed: THE TWO OPEN PLANTS NOW GO RED, and the
// plants themselves are byte-identical to Vira's — same expected set, same
// expected member, not one character moved to fit the fix (`git diff f7aab95
// HEAD -- tools/surfaces.mjs` is comments only). 7/7, exit 0. They STAY in the
// corpus, exactly as plants 1–5 did after the defects they name were closed: a
// red that has fired once is the only thing standing between a property and its
// next regression. What her removal condition retires is the OPEN framing above,
// not the lines — and that call is hers to confirm, so I have left her comment
// blocks and her commit whole rather than tidying them into my own words.
//
// VIKI AGAIN, folding her RE-GATE: P8 NOW GOES RED TOO — 8/8. Same discipline,
// and it matters more the second time: her plant block below is untouched, her
// commit is underneath mine with her name on it, and the plants array in this
// file has not changed by one character in either fold. What did change here is
// mine and only mine: the S1/S2 lines above, this paragraph, and the printer,
// which now shows EACH HOME'S OWN COUNT under any set that has more than one.
// That last is not decoration — her breadcrumb is *"watch for a member count
// that goes DOWN while the verdict stays OK"*, and a per-set total is precisely
// the number that cannot show it. Her P8 comment still says the plant MISSes on
// purpose. It no longer does; the sentence is hers to retire, not mine to edit.
