// tools/dirorder.mjs — the one home for "what order do we read a directory in?"
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
// -------------------
// A build tool that iterates a directory with a bare `readdirSync` inherits the
// FILESYSTEM's order, and that order is not a property of the repo — it is a
// property of the machine. `build/AshenSpire.html` as committed at 40c5b21 proves
// it: its ASSET_MAP holds the same 97 keys as a Linux rebuild, in an order that
// differs at exactly two positions —
//
//     committed : … enemy_blightedValkyrie.webp , enemy_blightHound.webp …
//     rebuilt   : … enemy_blightHound.webp      , enemy_blightedValkyrie.webp …
//
// The committed order is CASE-INSENSITIVE collation ("blighted" < "blighth"),
// i.e. the shipped bundle was built on a case-insensitive filesystem (NTFS or
// APFS). So the artifact could not be reproduced — and therefore could not be
// verified by hash — from its own source at its own ref.
//
// THE TRAP, and it is the reason this is a module and not two `.sort()` calls:
// `localeCompare` and any case-insensitive comparator REPRODUCE the bad order.
// The fix is only a fix because it is byte order — locale-independent,
// collation-independent, identical on every runner. Written once, here, with the
// reason attached; a `.sort()` at each call site is the decision copied twice
// with its reason nowhere.
//
// Callers: tools/bundle.mjs (assets/ sweep), tools/content-build.mjs
// (content/source sweep). Both previously held this decision, and only one of
// them knew it.
//
// WHY THERE IS A CORPUS BELOW, and who put it there
// -------------------------------------------------
// Everything above this line existed at 4dd963a and asserted NOTHING. Vira signed
// #8 by reinstating the defect instead of arguing about it: in a real clone she
// swapped the comparator to `a.localeCompare(b)`, regenerated the artifacts the way
// an "improver" would, and got `verify-shipped` 4/4, `--selftest` 9/9,
// `tests/run-node.mjs` 34/0 and `git diff --exit-code -- build dist` CLEAN — over a
// bundle whose ASSET_MAP key order was byte-for-byte the 40c5b21 defect order
// again, 97 of 97. Every check in this PR green over the exact bug the branch is
// named after.
//
// The paragraphs above are the tell, not the guard. Lines 11-12 had the fixture
// already typed — as prose, with nothing asserting either string. That is the same
// shape I convicted bundle.mjs of one commit earlier: the defect named in prose,
// the guard unable to fire. So:
//
//   node tools/dirorder.mjs --selftest   the corpus — must pass
//   node tools/dirorder.mjs --mutate     reinstate the defect N ways; each must be
//                                        CAUGHT. Inverted expectation, so the
//                                        corpus is one nobody has to take on trust.
//
// The fixture is history's, not mine: the 34 names of assets/sprites/ in the order
// the 40c5b21 bundle recorded them (a case-insensitive filesystem's readdir), and
// the fact that byte order differs from it at exactly two positions. A synthesized
// pair would be my opinion about the trap; this pair is the trap.
//
// It does NOT rebuild anything, on purpose. My own boundary in ci.yml says building
// twice in one tree can never catch this, because readdir order is stable per
// filesystem — so a corpus that reached for a rebuild would be re-measuring the
// machine. The fixture is the point.
//
// REMOVAL CONDITION (SOP 1's corollary): delete this file the day fewer than two
// tools read a directory whose order reaches a shipped artifact — one caller is a
// local helper and belongs inline. Also delete it if a future build stops
// embedding iteration order in its output at all (e.g. the asset map becomes a
// sorted-at-load structure), because then the order is no longer observable and
// this guard is guarding nothing.
//
// REMOVAL CONDITION FOR THE CORPUS specifically: it goes when the comparator goes,
// and not before — it is deleted with this file, never separately, because a
// comparator here with no corpus is the state Vira falsified. Two narrower edits
// are allowed rather than deletion: (a) if the assets/sprites/ pair is ever
// renamed, the fixture stays as it is — it is a frozen historical listing, not a
// mirror of the working tree, and it must NOT be regenerated to match a later
// tree; (b) a mutation drops out of --mutate only when that mutation becomes
// impossible to write here, not when it becomes unlikely. It is NOT removed for
// having passed a long time — a --mutate that stops catching things is the alarm.
