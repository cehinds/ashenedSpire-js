// Produces the "elite HP vs. average deck DPS" sanity table the M3 acceptance
// criteria call for, plus an empirical tier-1 win-rate pass driven by the same
// naive bot the tests use. Pure engine calls — no UI, deterministic per seed.
//
// Sections printed as Markdown (piped into docs/BALANCE.md):
//   1. Enemy roster: avg HP, weighted intent DPS, self-heal/turn, poise.
//   2. Encounters: total HP + incoming DPS per encounter (elites/bosses flagged).
//   3. Player baselines: MEASURED naive starting-deck DPS per class.
//   4. Sanity table: elites/bosses — turns-to-kill at reference DPS bands vs.
//      turns-to-die, with an unbeatable-by-construction (heal >= DPS) check.
//   5. Tier-1 empirical: greedy-bot win rate + avg HP lost, starting decks.
//   7. Recorded runsim reports, copied verbatim from docs/balance-runs.md.
//
// "Tier" is the seat's authored baseTier (SPEC §13.1) — the act a seat's numbers

// seat its order put there; the tier is what those numbers were balanced for.
