// tools/mapplan.mjs — the data-driven tooling for map config (SPEC §6).
//
// Constantine: "make this configurable by data driven tooling." Marina's ruling
// is that a knob-turning preview REQUIRES a readout, so this is one tool with
// two halves and neither ships without the other:
//
//   READOUT   what every floor rule RESOLVES TO at a given act length —
//             "fixed treasure -> floor 9 (fraction 0.64 of 14 rollable)".
//             Turn `floors` to 10 and read floor 6. That is the feature.
//   CHECK     whether the resulting maps hold their promises, ACROSS A
//             DISTRIBUTION and never on one seed.
//
// WHY A DISTRIBUTION IS THE WHOLE POINT (Marina, from Freja's 24-seed run):
// node count per act is 57.3 mean over a 46-64 range. A tool that generates one
// seed and reports 46 has said nothing, and a tool that generates one seed and
// reports 57 has said nothing either — it is the same green a tool gives when
// it checked nothing (`verify-shipped: OK - 0 checks passed`). Every number
// below is n seeds with its range printed beside it, and the range is not
// decoration: a promise that holds at the mean and fails at the tail is broken.
//
// Usage
//   node tools/mapplan.mjs                      readout + check, shipped acts
//   node tools/mapplan.mjs --floors 10          preview a different act length
//   node tools/mapplan.mjs --floors 10 --columns 6 --paths 6
//   node tools/mapplan.mjs --seeds 48           widen the distribution
//   node tools/mapplan.mjs --selftest           the known-bad corpus, only
//   node tools/mapplan.mjs --shape floors=8,columns=4,elite=40
//                                               DEFAULT vs SHAPED — the debug
//                                               run-shape knobs, asserted
//   node tools/mapplan.mjs --shape-selftest     the run-shape known-bad corpus
//   node tools/mapplan.mjs --selftest           the known-bad corpora, only
//   node tools/mapplan.mjs --margins            the pair census; exit 1 on a collision
//
// Exit codes
//   0  every act resolves, and every promise holds across the distribution
//   1  a finding
//   2  usage, or NOTHING RUN — which is unknown, never a pass
//
// OBSERVED RED: `--selftest` carries the corpus this tool exists to turn red —
// six inputs that `floorRules: opt(any)` accepted in silence, plus the shipped
// `15: 'shrine'` rule that had never fired. Numbers in the handback. The corpus
// is Vira's from the #43 audit and Viki's `requires: opt(any)` is its second
// instance, so it is not fitted to the one case we happened to find.
//
// AND THE MARGINS, 2026-08-08. A derived refusal that prints a VERDICT and not a
// MARGIN cannot be watched: `columns ≤ 9` said accepted and never "by 2%", and
// the circles that grew to meet the tap floor closed the space between them in
// the same stroke. Both axes compute a margin with a floor that can go red now,
// and the rows that falsify them are in this file — the corpus
// `model/validate.js` already points at, so its pointer is not a dangling one.
//
// THE PAIR CENSUS IS THE PART THAT CAUGHT SOMETHING REAL, and it caught it only
// after Sunna corrected the shape: the first version measured `ROW_H - 2*NODE_R`,
// two identical circles, on a screen whose one colliding pair is the BOSS over
// the top shrine — different radius, so the invariant could not express the pair
// that was actually red. `--margins` ranges over the pairs that exist and EXITS 1
// TODAY on that overlap: -3.7 SVG units, rendered in every act since #107.
//
// REMOVAL CONDITION: deleted the day floor rules carry no anchors (nothing to
// resolve, so no readout to print), or on Constantine's word.

//               real graphs and check the observed fan-out against the formula

// THE MEASUREMENT model/mapview.js's `maxFanoutSpan` IS, and the reason it is a
// function there rather than a number. It sweeps acts, reports the widest
// framing the generator can ask the camera to draw, and checks the formula
// against what it just measured. An observed maximum is a FLOOR under the true
// worst case, so this run can only ever falsify the formula, never confirm it —
// and that asymmetry is the point: the day an act produces a wider fan-out than
// the formula claims, this goes red and the refusal edge moves rather than
// quietly becoming optimistic.
//
// IT SWEEPS A GRID NOW, NOT A LINE — Vira, #107. The formula is closed in
// `columns`, but the quantity depends on three knobs: `columns` bounds the
// spread, `pathCount` decides how many walkers can merge into one node, and
// `floors` decides how many chances the walk gets to do it. Sweeping only
// `columns` validated a one-knob claim along one line of a three-dimensional
// space and printed a confident PASS. The other two are swept here, and the
// verdict line says how many cells the pass covers rather than how many widths.

 *
 * Constantine: "I only have the patience for 30 min runs. perhaps add an
 * advanced debug feature to limit the amount of max columns, rows, and or
 * columns with percent chance of certain nodes being more likely."
 *
 * The knobs ship on Custom Climb. THIS is the half that says whether they did
 * anything, and it is the half that is easy to skip: a weighting table that is
 * read and never changes what the generator produces is the exact failure this
 * family keeps catching. So the mode below does not print two tables and invite
 * a reader to compare them — it ASSERTS the comparison and can go red:
 *
 *   the harness moved      distinct rng streams AND distinct graphs, both arms
 *   the shape moved        a shape that leaves the population identical is a
 *                          FINDING, not a tidy result
 *   the weights moved      every type NAMED in the shape must move its share of
 *                          the map in the direction its weight moved, measured
 *                          on a weights-only arm so the floors/columns caps
 *                          cannot be what shifted it
 *
 * `--shape-selftest` is the known-bad corpus for all three (observed red before
 * any of it is cited — the instrument rule).

  (a) NOT A PLAY TEST. Every number is a count over a generated graph. Whether a
      10-floor act FEELS like a climb is Sunna's call, and Freja measured that 12
      is the last shape that still leans upward rather than reading as a field.
      No number here can answer it.
  (b) REACHABILITY IS REPORTED, NOT ENFORCED. 'minElites' counts nodes in the
      whole graph. The starts-that-reach-nothing figures above are measured and
      printed; nothing fails on them, and making the generator honour them is a
      design change nobody has approved.
  (c) THE '?' NODES ARE NOT RESOLVED HERE. unknownWeights is read out and its
      total is checked; what a given '?' becomes is engine/encounters.js on the
      'events' stream, and this tool never runs it.
  (d) ONE PLATFORM, one RNG implementation, no browser. This is arithmetic over
      the generator, not evidence that a map renders.
  (e) NOT 'verified-at' ANY CI REF — hand-run, like everything on this repo.`);
