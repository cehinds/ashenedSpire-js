// tools/statusreach.mjs — CAN A PLAYER EVER MEET THIS STATUS?
//
// Every row in content/statuses.js is applied by something a player can
// actually encounter, or this goes red and names the row.
//
// Rune, 2026-08-08. Law 1 clause 1 says adding content never touches code —
// a status is a row. This is that clause's FALSIFIER, and its absence is why
// the following shipped and stayed shipped:
//
//   `frost`     threshold 10, burst 8% of max HP, leaves Weak + Frost-Exposed,
//               its own resist row, its own SFX row (procBurst_frost).
//   `insanity`  threshold 14, the biggest burst, +8 Poise, a GUARANTEED
//               Stagger, its own exposure row, its own SFX row.
//
//   Appliers, across all of src/content, at dev = cd3da94:  ZERO. Both.
//
// Everything downstream of them was built and tested — the engine procs them
// (tests 7b, 7c, 7e, 7g), the validator rules on every knob (7f), Vega wrote
// them each a burst sound (#66) — and the card named FROST NOVA applied `weak`
// and `vulnerable`. Bleed was applied 21 times. Nobody noticed, for the same
// reason nobody notices any of these: every instrument downstream was green,
// because every instrument downstream tested the row and not the WAY IN.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE TRAP THIS FILE IS BUILT AROUND, and it is not hypothetical: the audit
// that found the defect used `/applyStatus[^}]*status:'frost'/` over src/content
// and the first hit it reported was a `resists:` declaration — a row that
// REDUCES incoming frost, matched as if it produced some. A grep cannot tell a
// READER of a status from an APPLIER of one, and that difference is the entire
// question. So nothing here is a text scan. This walks the loaded content
// graph and counts one shape only:
//
//     { op: 'applyStatus', status: '<id>' }
//
// and NOT, deliberately, each of these — every one of which mentions a status
// id and none of which applies it:
//
//     resists: { status }                   bleedResist RESISTS bleed
//     taggedVulnerability: { tags }         a damage multiplier, not a source
//     { p: 'hasStatus', status }            a predicate READS it
//     { p: 'eventStatusIs', status }        a predicate READS it
//     { f: 'stacks', status }               a formula READS it
//     { op: 'removeStatus', status }        the opposite of an applier
//     an equipMods ROW                      the VOCABULARY, not a use of it
//
// The last one is why `bundle.equipment` is never walked generically: its rows
// literally carry `op: 'applyStatus'` in a COLUMN, so a blind walk would count
// the dictionary as a sentence and hand every mod-able status a free green.
// Equipment gets route R4 below instead, which needs BOTH halves.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE ROUTES, ENUMERATED FROM THE ENGINE, because a reach model that guesses is
// a reach model that reports a plausible number:
//
//   R1  content   an `applyStatus` op inside a non-status content entry:
//                 cards (base AND upgrade), relics, enemies, events, flasks,
//                 stances, classes, and `balance` (balance.poise.onFill is
//                 where `staggered` is applied — engine/combat.js consults it
//                 and never names the status).
//   R2  status    an `applyStatus` op inside a REACHED status's own hooks[].do
//                 or proc.effects. Transitive: frostExposed is reachable
//                 because frost is, and stops being reachable the day frost
//                 does. (engine/statuses.js checkProcFill)
//   R3  resist    proc.resistance.status of a REACHED proc status — enqueued
//                 by the engine, not by content (engine/statuses.js:142).
//   R4  equip     an equipMods row whose `apply` is `status`/`startStatus`,
//                 AND at least one armament or armour row whose `mods` names
//                 that field. BOTH halves, or it is vocabulary nobody speaks.
//                 (model/loadout.js applyCardMods / runMods)
//   R5  code      a CLOSED, DECLARED list of appliers that live in code rather
//                 than content. Today it has exactly one member and that is
//                 itself a finding, stated below.
//   R6  exposure  an enemy row's arcaneExposure.onBreak.status. The engine
//                 (engine/actions.js applyArcaneExposure) applies it when
//                 magic-school buildup crosses the row's threshold — the
//                 applier is DATA ON THE ENEMY ROW, exactly where Law 1 wants
//                 it. THREE halves, all data, all required, or it is
//                 vocabulary nobody speaks (R4's rule, one system over):
//                   (a) an enemy with mode:'configured' naming onBreak.status
//                   (b) at least one shipped carrier — a card or a
//                       basicCardProfile with exposureBuildupPerHit >= 1 —
//                       whose school the balance table maps above zero
//                   (c) floor(perHit * schoolMult * buildupMultiplier) >= 1
//                       for that pairing, because that is the engine's own
//                       arithmetic and an amount that floors to 0 never fills.
//                 Added 2026-08-13: the Codex attribute/exposure work landed
//                 this door after R1-R5 were enumerated, and this tool did
//                 exactly what its boundary promised — went red, loudly, on
//                 `magicVulnerable` at dev = 86564e6 rather than guessing.
//
// R5 IS THE WEAKEST EDGE IN THIS FILE AND IT IS A SUBSTRING MATCH — the same
// technique this file's own header calls a trap. It is admissible only because
// it is CLOSED (one entry), RATCHETED (a declared needle that has vanished is
// a FAILURE, never a silent drop back to red), and because the alternative is
// worse: `glassCannon` would sit red forever for a reason that is not the class
// this check exists to catch, and "the first person to see a check permanently
// red turns it off."
//
// THE FINDING R5 RECORDS, not fixed here because it is not content:
// src/main.js:1101 does `if (mods.glassCannon) playerStatuses.push({ status:
// 'glassCannon', stacks: 1 })`. The Custom Climb mod IDs are data
// (content/customMods.js); the mapping from id to status is code. A fourth
// chaos mod granting a status is an engine edit today. That is Law 1 clause 1's
// business, and it is one line to fix by moving the status onto the mod row —
// on the day someone owns that call.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE FLOORS — because an empty population is how a dead instrument prints a
// plausible number (`verify-shipped: OK — 0 checks passed`, and eleven more in
// one session). Each one exits non-zero; none of them is a softer bucket than
// red (SOP 2's silence guard):
//
//   F1  zero statuses in the bundle                -> the population is gone
//   F2  a NAMED source set is empty                -> the walk went blind
//   F3  zero appliers found anywhere               -> the matcher stopped matching
//   F4  a declared R5 needle is no longer in its file
//
// F3 is the one that matters most and it is cheap: one edit to the shape this
// file matches on turns "43 statuses, 43 reached" into "43 statuses, 43
// UNREACHED" — loud — but one edit to the SOURCE SETS turns it into a green
// over nothing. F2 is what stops that.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// KNOWN-BAD FIRST, AND THE PLANT ENTERS BY THE DOOR THE REAL INPUT ENTERS
// (development.md, The instrument rule). The house's base rate this session:
// eleven instruments ran dead and printed a plausible number, and every failed
// plant entered downstream of the defect it was meant to catch. So:
//
//   this check reads the STATUS TABLE          -> the plant is a table row
//   this check reads CONTENT FILES             -> the plant is a content file
//
// OBSERVED RED, on the real tree, by editing the real files (see --selftest for
// the in-memory equivalents; all four below were watched at
// dev = cd3da94 + tools/axisfit.mjs, 2026-08-08, node v22, one Linux box):
//
//   1. THE DEFECT, with no plant at all — `node tools/statusreach.mjs` on the
//      unmodified content of dev = cd3da94:
//        FAIL — 6 of 43 shipped statuses have no applier: frost, insanity,
//        frostResist, insanityResist, frostExposed, insanityExposed
//        exit 1
//      Six, not two: the two proc rows took their resist rows and their
//      exposure rows down with them, which is R2/R3 being transitive and is
//      the honest size of the hole.
//   2. A new row `plantedRimeAsh` appended to src/content/statuses.js — the
//      population's own door:
//        FAIL — 7 of 44 … plantedRimeAsh, exit 1.
//   3. `strike.burn=+2` deleted from `torch` (and `gorefireBrand`) in
//      content/source/weapons.csv, recompiled — R4's door:
//        FAIL — 7 of 43 … burn, exit 1. The mod field still exists; nothing
//        wields it; that is not reach.
//   4. All 25 `{op:'applyStatus', … status:'bleed'}` lines deleted from the
//      nine real content files, plus the katana's `strike.bleed=+2`:
//        FAIL — 8 of 43 … bleed, bleedResist, exit 1. bleedResist fell WITH
//        it: a resist row for a status nobody applies is just as unreachable.
//      (21 was the number in the audit; 25 is what the tree actually holds,
//      counted by the deletion. The audit's regex was per-line and missed the
//      status-hook and flask ones — which is the same blind spot again.)
//
// Usage
//   node tools/statusreach.mjs             the shipped bundle
//   node tools/statusreach.mjs --json      machine-readable
//   node tools/statusreach.mjs --selftest  plant all eight mechanisms
//
// Exit codes
//   0  every shipped status has a way in
//   1  a status no player can reach  (EXPECTED on dev at cd3da94)
//   2  a floor fired — the population or the walk went empty. NEVER a pass.
//
// REMOVAL CONDITION (SOP 1's corollary): delete this file the day the status
// table is generated FROM the appliers rather than authored beside them —
// then an unreachable row cannot be written and this has no subject. It is
// WRONG, and rewritten rather than deleted, the first time a status this file
// calls reached turns out to be unreachable in play: reachability of the
// APPLIER is what a player meets, and this checks that the applier exists, not
// that a run can ever draw it.

const BOUNDARY = `
BOUNDARY — what a green from this tool does NOT mean:
  · REACHED IS NOT EFFECTIVE. This proves something APPLIES the status, never
    that applying it changes a hit. Frost-Exposed and Unraveled now consume
    tagging.csv identity through the action engine, and tests 7e2/7e3 play
    real shipped cards through both preview and execution. This tool runs none
    of that damage path; it stays silent about effectiveness by construction.
  · REACHED IS NOT DRAWABLE. A card with an applier still has to be in a class
    pool, a rewardable rarity, and a run's RNG. This reads the definition, not
    the run. tools/runsim.mjs is the half that plays.
  · REACHED IS NOT BALANCED. Every number touched on the way here is marked
    PROVISIONAL in its own row and none of it has been through the sim.
  · R5 IS A SUBSTRING MATCH in one file, and the header says why that is
    admissible exactly once and never twice.
  · R6 PROVES THE METER CAN FILL, NOT THAT A RUN FILLS IT. A carrier that
    steps the meter by 1 against a threshold of 8 is eight landed magic hits
    on one enemy — whether that ever happens in a real climb is the sim's
    question (every number on that path is marked PROVISIONAL), not this
    tool's. Reach here means the arithmetic cannot floor to zero.
  · THE UPGRADE PATH IS WALKED, the equipment path is walked, the intent path
