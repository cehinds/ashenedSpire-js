#!/usr/bin/env node
// tools/saveroundtrip.mjs — IS A SAVE A FIXED POINT OF THE SAVE DOOR?
//
// THE ONE QUESTION. Write a save, read it back, write it again: are the two
// writes the same bytes? And: does a save written by an OLDER build come
// forward with every player-owned number intact — no field quietly dropped,
// no field quietly filled with a plausible default?
//
// WHY IT IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION FROM THE ONES ALREADY ASKED HERE. At
// dev = 7e67de8 (PR #178, CON restored, relic resource authority data-driven)
// tools/conhp.mjs proves the D22 formula and checks NAMED fields across a
// save/load — maxHp, hp, maxHpAdjustment, the allocation. tests/engine.test.js
// 50c proves a retired-name save loads healed and re-serializes with zero dead
// bytes. Both walk a LIST OF FIELDS SOMEBODY THOUGHT OF. Neither asks the
// whole-artifact question: is the SAVE — every byte of it — unchanged by a
// trip through the door? A field nobody listed is exactly the field a
// migration eats, and it goes on reading green in both of those tools forever.
//
// THE TRAP THIS IS POINTED AT — Law 1 clause 5 / Law 0 clause 5, verbatim:
// *"Silent plausible derivation is the dangerous failure. A missing field that
// fails loud is cheap; a generated thing that is wrong but reasonable is
// invisible."* A load door that fills a gap with a class preset does not crash,
// does not warn, and produces a run that is internally consistent with itself.
// Nothing downstream can tell. Only the BEFORE bytes can, which is why this
// tool keeps them and compares against them rather than against expectations.
//
// THE DOOR — printed by door() below, in this run's own output, because the
// instrument rule's same-door clause (commons/development.md, family repo) says
// an observation that cannot name its entry point has not made the claim:
//
//   Every save here enters as BYTES under the real storage key 'sote_run_v1'
//   (RUN_KEY, src/engine/save.js), written by createSaveManager(storage).saveRun
//   and read by .loadRun(registries) — the same two calls the game makes at
//   src/main.js:579 (persist) and src/main.js:755 (resumeRun). Registries come
//   from the real content boot: src/content/index.js -> validateContent ->
//   createRegistries. NOTHING is handed to deserializeRun, migrateRunSchema,
//   normalizeRunAttributes, initializeRunDerivedStats or initializeRunFlaskCharges
//   directly — those are the stages under test, not the entry point.
//
// THE OLD-VOCABULARY SAVES ARE NOT HAND-TYPED, AND THEY LIVE IN ONE HOME.
// tests/fixtures/run-save-vigour-window.json is the frozen Vigour-window
// corpus — every entry the exact bytes some build's own saveRun wrote, with its
// ref and its reason in the file's own `_provenance` block. This tool reads
// three of its entries plus the older Constitution-era fixture 50c reads:
//   · constitutionEra   schemaVersion 2, dev = 5f58bca — the last tree before
//                       the rename.
//   · vigourEraNative   schemaVersion 3, a run CREATED at dev = d7d1920, the
//                       build every player was on the hour before #178 merged.
//   · vigourEraPlayed   schemaVersion 3, same build, a PLAYED herald: floor 4,
//                       a real act map, 137 cinders, a loseMaxHpPct curse, an HP
//                       deficit and a spent flask charge. A fresh save is the
//                       easy case; every value this one carries is one a player
//                       would notice losing. Added for this tool.
//   · tests/fixtures/run-save-constitution-acb8ffe.json — schemaVersion 2,
//     frozen at dev = acb8ffe; already in the tree, and 50c's.
// A substituted string ("constitution" -> "vigour") is a guess about what the
// old build wrote. These are what it wrote.
//
// AND THE DEAD NAME IN THAT FILE IS DELIBERATE — said in the file's own first
// key, and now PLANTED. The frozen entries spell `vigour` because the population
// they stand for spells `vigour`; a corpus normalized to the live name would
// pass every check below while proving nothing about the saves that actually
// exist on players' disks. The corpus carries that warning at its first key, and
// the warning's central promise — "each reader goes RED BY NAME if the
// vocabulary is modernised" — was true by reading and never once observed. The
// --selftest corpus now plants that exact tidy-up ("the frozen corpus is
// normalized to the live name"), so groupB's `mustContain` gate is watched
// rather than merely asserted. Plant added by Sten on Marina's order,
// 2026-08-16; the warning and the fixtures are Vira's. A purpose that lives only
// in prose is one refactor from gone.
//
// I BUILT THE SECOND COPY MYSELF AND THEN COLLAPSED IT. Branching off dev, I
// regenerated Vigour-era fixtures my own earlier session had already frozen and
// pushed at 9c83856 — one fact, two homes, nothing keeping them in sync, which
// is the defect this house exists to catch. That branch is merged in here and
// its file is the single home; my two loose fixtures are deleted, and the one
// artifact of mine that was genuinely new (the played herald) moved into it.
//
// WHAT RED MEANS HERE. Not "a number is wrong" — this tool holds no opinion
// about any number. It only says: THIS number is not the number that went in.
// Every failure names the field, the fixture, and both values.
//
// SELFTEST: `node tools/saveroundtrip.mjs --selftest` plants six known-bads
// into a COPY of the real tree via tools/doorplant.mjs and runs this whole file
// from that copy, so each plant enters as file bytes on the road the real input
// travels. Five break the door; the sixth breaks the corpus. Observed red
// 2026-08-15 at dev = 7e67de8 for the first five — see the log entry
// gamedesign/vira/log/2026/2026-08-15_the-save-that-came-back-whole.md — and
// 2026-08-16 at 7e968f2 for the corpus plant.
//
// REMOVAL CONDITION (SOP 1's corollary): deleted the day the run save stops
// being a persisted artifact — no bytes, no fixed point, no subject.

BOUNDARY — what this green does NOT cover.

  · IT MEASURES THE RUN SAVE ONLY. The durable PROFILE (sote_meta_v1), its
    backup mirror, and the archive drawer are a different artifact with a
    different schema (META_SCHEMA_VERSION) and a different set of failure
    modes; tools/profile-durability-probe.mjs is their instrument, not this one.
  · IT NEVER OPENS A BROWSER. Every save here lives in an in-memory storage
    stub with localStorage's shape. A quota refusal, a killed tab mid-write, or
    a browser that stringifies differently is untouched by this green.
  · ONE PLATFORM, ONE RUNTIME. Node ${process.version} on ${process.platform}.
    JSON key order is an implementation property; a runtime that ordered object
    keys differently would fail the byte comparison for a reason that is not a
    defect. It has been observed identical here and nowhere else.
  · THREE OLDER BUILDS, NOT ALL OF THEM. Fixtures exist for schemaVersion 2
    (constitution) and 3 (vigour). schemaVersion 1 is still ACCEPTED by
    migrateRunSchema and NO fixture in this tree was written by a v1 build —
    that path is 'unknown', not green, and aging will not fix it.
  · IT ASKS WHETHER A SAVE SURVIVES THE DOOR, NEVER WHETHER THE NUMBERS ARE
    RIGHT. If D22 derives the wrong HP, this tool is silent: it only reports
    that whatever went in came back. tools/conhp.mjs holds the formula.

FINDING RULED ON 2026-08-15 — and the ruling changed what is carried here, so
read the next paragraph before the old text below it.

  Marina's ruling (R-1/R-2, one act): this finding and Sten's swallowed
  double-count at run creation are ONE defect — a last-writer-wins reconcile
  that keeps no record of what it overwrote. The act shipped is VISIBILITY,
  explicitly not a refusal and explicitly not the collapse of the three max-HP
  homes. Every heal below now NAMES ITSELF through this same door:
  saves.runStatus() reports state 'ok' | 'healed' | 'archived' with a ledger
  naming the site, the field, both values, the reason and the schemaVersion of
  the save it happened to. src/model/healLedger.js is the one home;
  tools/runcreation.mjs is the instrument and drives both doors.

  WHAT IS STILL CARRIED, unchanged: whether a current-schema save missing a
  field should be REFUSED rather than healed. It is parked, deliberately, with
  a wake condition asserted in tools/runcreation.mjs group D — not left in
  prose here. The repro below still reproduces; the door no longer says nothing
  while it does it.

  Three fields are optional in RUN_SHAPE with NO schemaVersion gate, so the
  migration heals meant for old saves also fire on a CURRENT-schema (v${RUN_SCHEMA_VERSION}) save:

    attributes / attributeMode  ->  refilled from the class preset
                                    (src/model/attributes.js normalizeRunAttributes)
    loadout                     ->  refilled with the class starting loadout
                                    (src/engine/save.js loadRun)
    flaskCharges                ->  rebuilt, every spent charge reset
                                    (src/model/state.js initializeRunFlaskCharges)

  Repro — a v${RUN_SCHEMA_VERSION} save with its allocation deleted, loaded through the same door
  as everything above. It returns a run with the class preset and says nothing.
  Copy this whole block into a shell at the repo root:

    node --input-type=module -e "
    import { contentBundle } from './src/content/index.js';
    import { createRegistries } from './src/model/registries.js';
    import { createRunState } from './src/model/state.js';
    import { createMemoryStorage, createSaveManager, RUN_KEY } from './src/engine/save.js';
    const REG = createRegistries(contentBundle);
    const st = createMemoryStorage(), saves = createSaveManager(st);
    saves.saveRun(createRunState({ seed: 7, classId: 'reaver', registries: REG }), null, 1);
    const o = JSON.parse(st.getItem(RUN_KEY));
    delete o.attributes; delete o.attributeMode;
    st.setItem(RUN_KEY, JSON.stringify(o));
    console.log('loaded:', JSON.stringify(saves.loadRun(REG, 1).attributes));
    "

  Observed 2026-08-15 at dev = 7e67de8:
    loaded: {"strength":13,"dexterity":10,"constitution":12,"wisdom":10,"intelligence":10}
  — the reaver preset, handed back for an allocation that was not in the file.

  By the module's own contract that would be refused by name (save.js: bad
  saves are ARCHIVED, never silently replaced; Law 1 clause 5). THIS TOOL DOES
  NOT ASSERT IT, and the reason is not squeamishness: tests/engine.test.js 28
  and 50 currently assert the OPPOSITE — 28 deletes 'loadout' from a
  current-schema run and requires it to heal. Two shipped tests encode the
  present behaviour as intended, so whether a v${RUN_SCHEMA_VERSION} save missing a field should heal
  or refuse is a DESIGN CALL, and it is not an instrument's to make. Gating
  those three fields on schemaVersion 1 (the gate startingKitId already uses)
  turns tests 28 and 50 red — measured 2026-08-15 at dev = 7e67de8.

  WAKE CONDITION — it has a RED now, and it does not live here.
  Ruled 2026-08-15: a refusal ships with a red on its WAKE, not only on its
  refusing (commons/development.md, Freja's clause), and this paragraph was the
  refusing half — always green, because absence never fails a test written to
  expect absence. The premise is now asserted by a machine:

    node tools/runcreation.mjs      group D — "this build writes no save its
                                    own door must heal"; RED the moment
                                    healedOnCurrentSchema is non-zero on an
                                    untouched round trip. Observed red on a
                                    planted premise-death, same door.

  The two conditions that retire this paragraph, unchanged in substance:
    · tests 28 and 50 stop requiring a current-schema save to heal — then the
      design call has been made and the assertion moves into Group B;
    · or group D goes red — then it has been made for us.
  An excuse that outlives its defect is how a suite goes green over a bug
  (Law 5's enforcement note).
