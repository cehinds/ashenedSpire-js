// matters: it FELL BACK instead of failing. On one ordinary edit to
// src/content/index.js (`'0.4.0'` → `"0.4.0"`, single quotes to double) the
// original throws by name; the copy returned '0.0.0' and shipped
// dist/AshenSpire-0.0.0.html with nothing said. Bjorn found it; it had been
// here since the launcher was written. A second implementation of a rule is a
// second chance to disagree with it, and this one disagreed silently.

/**
 * The release half of the version, from src/content/index.js via the one home.
 *
 * NO FALLBACK, DELIBERATELY — Marina's MR-263: *when the version cannot be
 * derived, fail loudly — never emit a plausible filename.* `0.0.0` was
 * precisely a plausible filename. That is what made it worse than a crash: it
 * is not obviously wrong on disk, it is not obviously wrong pasted into a bug
 * report, and it reads as a fact on the box. A launcher that cannot find the
 * release does not know what it is building and must say so.
 *
 * This matters more than it did last week because Constantine has since given a
 * standing instruction that a build carries its name AND its version. The
 * DECIDED half of that — name plus version, DERIVED rather than typed — is what
 * the copyFileSync calls below already do.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT DECIDED IS STILL NOT GUESSED AT HERE: the `dev` channel field
 * (which exists nowhere in this tree) and whether the source digest belongs in
 * a name read aloud on a phone call are both open, and inventing an answer to
 * either would mint a second version scheme — the exact subject SOP 5 and
 * tools/buildversion.mjs exist to forbid.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED 2026-08-16, AND IT IS THE VERSION AND NOT THE SHAPE. This read
 * `release(ROOT)`, so every build in this project's history was handed over as
 * `AshenSpire-0.4.0.html` — 139 shipped bundles, two distinct names. A file you
 * cannot tell apart from the last one is the defect Constantine's rule of that
 * day is aimed at, arriving on the surface he actually receives. It now reads
 * `buildVersion(ROOT)`, which is the same fact with its ordering tail attached,
 * so `AshenSpire-0.4.0.0618.html` sorts in a directory listing the way he asked
 * a build to sort. The shape — `<name>-<version>.html` — is untouched, and the
 * padding is what makes the listing sort right rather than a style choice.
