// tools/mobilefit.mjs — can a finger reach the combat controls, at every shape
// we ship, in both orientations?
//
// This is the browser instrument for EldenSpire #21 and #23. Sunna measured both
// by hand on the shipped bundle at `bf18a2e`; this re-runs her two edges on
// demand so a proposed fix can be judged by the same numbers rather than by an
// adjective. It measures nothing about how any of it FEELS — that stays her read.
//
// WHAT IT ASSERTS
//   1. #21's reach grid. A 45-point grid over each required combat control,
//      hit-tested with elementFromPoint. Sunna's known-bad is `.end-turn` at
//      0/45 on all three portrait shapes; her green is 45/45 at 844x390. Both
//      are re-run here on every invocation, so the grid is observed red before
//      any number it prints is used as coverage (development.md, The instrument
//      rule).
//   2. #23's fit invariant, in two forms, because the literal one stops being
//      meaningful the moment a layout gains a narrow mode:
//        (a) LITERAL — appliedZoom x designW <= innerWidth, with designW read
//            from balance.ui.uiScale, whatever the running code says it needs.
//        (b) OBSERVATIONAL — the app's own scrollWidth does not exceed the
//            viewport, and no required control's box crosses a viewport edge.
//      (a) is Sunna's card verbatim. (b) is the thing (a) is a proxy FOR, and it
//      survives a design baseline that changes. A fix that satisfies (a) by
//      redefining designW and still bleeds is caught by (b), and only by (b).
//   3. #23's second, independent mechanism: page-level scroll travel, PAGE-LEVEL
//      AND NOTHING ELSE. It is still reported below and it is still not this
//      tool's assertion — but read the next paragraph before citing it.
//
// WHAT THIS TOOL'S HORIZONTAL NUMBER IS NOT. `docOverflowX` is
// `documentElement.scrollWidth - clientWidth`, and this app is `overflow:
// hidden` at the root, so it is ZERO BY CONSTRUCTION — measured across 14
// surfaces x 5 shapes at cd3da94, the document never once appeared as a
// scroller. The `clipped()` walk below then deliberately skips any element with
// a scrolling ancestor, and the bleed set is `.combat *`. So a green here is
// SILENCE about whether a scroller three elements down moves sideways, not
// coverage of it — the act map scrolls 401px across at 390x844 on the same tree
// where every number in this file is green. That axis has its own home and its
// own law: tools/axisfit.mjs, per SCROLL CONTAINER, over every ?shot= surface.
// This file keeps bleed; that one keeps travel; neither restates the other.
//
// The sentence that used to sit at item 3 — "whether a phone SHOULD scroll the
// board is a design call and not this tool's to make" — is DELETED, not
// amended. Constantine made the design call on 2026-08-08 and the family wrote
// it down as Law 5 (commons/laws.md, canonical, not restated here). An excuse
// that outlives its defect is how a suite goes green over a bug, and this file
// already deleted one knownOpen entry for exactly that reason.
//
// WHY LOCAL PX APPEAR NEXT TO VISUAL PX EVERYWHERE BELOW
//   The app is zoomed by `body { zoom: var(--ui-zoom) }`. Hit-testing and
//   getBoundingClientRect are VISUAL; layout authoring is LOCAL. A number without
//   its space is not a measurement (see tools/zoomplace.mjs's header, and
//   EldenSpire#15). Every reported pair is labelled.
//
// Usage
//   node tools/mobilefit.mjs                 source tree via tools/serve.mjs
//   node tools/mobilefit.mjs --dist          dist/AshenSpire.html (file://; http if pack-shaped — browser.mjs buildPageUrl)
//   node tools/mobilefit.mjs --only 390x844
//   node tools/mobilefit.mjs --shots DIR     also write a PNG per shape
//   CHROME=/path/to/chrome node tools/mobilefit.mjs
//
// Exit codes
//   0  every shape satisfied every assertion
//   1  an assertion failed  (expected on `dev` — that is the point)
//   2  usage / no browser / a board that would not mount — never a pass
//
// BOUNDARY, printed again at the end where a reader will see it:
//   Linux headless Chromium 1194 only. CDP device emulation is not a phone: it
//   carries viewport, DPR, the viewport meta and the touch event stream, and it
//   does NOT carry iOS/WebKit, real fonts, the OS gesture layer, or a thumb --
//   these touches land where aimed. It also does not carry a moving address bar:
//   measured in this harness, 100dvh, 100svh and 100lvh are all the same number,
//   so this tool can say NOTHING about the 60-100px the bar eats and returns.
//   It hit-tests reachability only; it never judges legibility.
