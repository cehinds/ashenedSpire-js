// tools/gatelist.mjs — WHICH INSTRUMENTS DOES A GATE ACTUALLY RUN, AND DOES IT
// LISTEN TO THE ANSWER?
//
// Bjorn Falk, 2026-08-21. The generator SOP 14 §5a has been waiting for.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS, and the reason is a measurement of us, not a theory.
//
// §5a reads "until a generator exists, the derivation is mechanical and stated
// in the verdict" — every exact-head PASS this house issues rests on a gate
// command set derived BY HAND. On 2026-08-21 two experienced hands derived that
// set wrongly, in opposite directions, inside one hour, neither knowing about
// the other: a grep for a tool name cannot tell `run:` from `echo`, so it counts
// coverage that does not exist; and my own first parse of this question returned
// FIVE browser instruments where the truth is TWO, because the boundary job's
// `run: |` payload is full of `echo` lines that NAME tools and I counted a
// string inside an echo as an execution. I built the exact defect this file is
// about, inside the fix for it, and needed two passes to see it.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS ANSWERS is #295's, one layer up: PR #224 passed exact-head
// review while `tools/hintstrip.mjs` — red for four days — sat in nobody's list.
// The instrument existed. The list was the defect.
//
// ⚠ AND THE SECOND HALF, WHICH IS VIRA'S FINDING AND NOT MINE. Being IN a list
// is not enough. I claimed at #301 that hintstrip's two steps were "a redundant
// pair", having planted `|| true` on step 1 and watched the job stay red. She
// derived from doorplant.mjs:181-186 that **the selftest's clean edge IS step 1
// re-run** — so the job stayed red because THE SAME CHECK FAILED TWICE, and the
// day the tree goes green a `|| true` on step 1 silences the gate completely.
// The redundancy evaporates at exactly the moment it would start to matter,
// because a green tree is the only state in which a regression can be
// introduced. **I observed a behaviour honestly and inferred a property it does
// not have** — my own failure mode, at the level of time rather than depth.
// G4 below is the close, and it is why this file asks a second question.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// THE SPECIFICATION — what counts as an INVOCATION. This is the deliverable.
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A tool is INVOKED when its path appears in COMMAND POSITION in something a
// list executes. Everything else is PROSE, however much it looks like coverage.
//
//  (1) SHELL LISTS (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). A step's `run:` payload is a
//      shell script, not a string. It is comment-stripped (a `#` at a word
//      boundary outside quotes begins a comment), split into COMMANDS on
//      newlines and on `;` `&&` `||` `|` `&`, and each command tokenized with
//      quotes respected. The FIRST token is command position; leading
//      `VAR=value` assignments and the delegating wrappers `env` `time` `exec`
//      `sudo` are stepped over. If it is `node` (bare or any path ending
//      `/node`), the first following non-flag token matching `tools/<name>` is
//      an invocation. Reached any other way — inside `echo`'s arguments, inside
//      a quoted string, after a `#` — it is NOT. A heredoc body is DATA and is
//      skipped; there are none in this repo today, and the rule is here so the
//      first one does not silently become "coverage".
//
//  (2) JS LISTS (`tests/run-node.mjs`). Comments are stripped first — this suite
//      names `tools/zoomplace.mjs` and `tools/release-shots.mjs` in comments and
//      in its printed boundary, and runs neither. An invocation is then a
//      `tools/<name>` string literal inside the ARGV ARRAY of an `execFileSync` /
//      `spawnSync` / `execSync` call. Any other position is prose.
//
//  (3) EXECUTED OUTPUT is the third thing, and collapsing it into either of the
//      above is how both of tonight's wrong counts happened. A `tools/<name>`
//      inside an `echo` payload or a `console.log` IS RUN — it reaches a reader
//      — but it EXECUTES NOTHING. So it is held to one rule (G1): such a line
//      either belongs to a tool the same list invokes, or it must SAY WHAT GOES
//      UNWATCHED. There is no marker to find and no job id typed here; the test
//      is on the line itself, so it travels to any list that prints a boundary.
//      A SOURCE COMMENT is not executed output and is not held to this at all —
//      documentation is allowed to name a tool.
//
// THE FOUR STATES, first match wins, and the precedence is stated because a tool
// can satisfy more than one:
//
//   listed                  invoked in command position by some gate list
//   excluded-with-a-reason  named in executed output WITH a stated cost
//   linked-but-never-run    reached by linkcheck's module walk, run by nothing
//   unlisted                not reached by anything
//
// ⚠ THE THIRD STATE IS THE DEFAULT CELL, NOT THE RARE ONE, AND I CHECKED THAT
// RATHER THAN ASSUMED IT. `tools/linkcheck.mjs`'s ROOTS are ['src','tools',
// 'tests'] and it reports "279/279 module graphs link … The walk covers every
// in-tree module regardless of who imports it." So run-node's cases 45-46 LINK
// every tool here and EXECUTE NOT ONE MODULE BODY, and the suite says so itself.
// The precedent is in 45-46's own comment: #88 renamed an export and left
// `release-shots.mjs` standing, the release floor cited it as green, and it
// exited 1 before a browser launched — NOT A FAILED CHECK, A FAILED LOAD.
// A green from a suite that LINKED an instrument is not a green from it.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// WHAT IS ASSERTED, AND WHAT IS ONLY REPORTED
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ASSERTED (this tool goes red):
//   G1 NO PROSE WEARING COVERAGE — a tool named in EXECUTED OUTPUT is invoked by
//      THE STEP THAT NAMES IT, or its line states a cost. Source comments are
//      exempt. ⚠ THE SCOPE IS THE STEP, NOT THE LIST, and that is not a detail:
//      a list-scoped test exempts a step emptied into an `echo` whenever a
//      SIBLING step keeps the tool-level listing alive, which is #295's defect
//      one degree finer — not "a tool in no list" but "a tool in a list that has
//      stopped running it HERE". Site-local, so it needs no baseline.
//      ⚠ WHAT REMAINS UNSEEN, and it is smaller but real: a step DELETED
//      OUTRIGHT, naming nothing, while another invocation of the same tool
//      survives. Nothing names it, so nothing fires. Closing that needs a
//      per-site baseline — a frozen number in a second home — and I would rather
//      state the gap than plant a rotting number. NAMED HERE AND IN THE OUTPUT,
//      not only here, because a boundary that lives only in a comment is how the
//      previous version of this clause shipped over its own residue.
//   G2 AN EXCLUSION NAMES ITS COST — D78: the reason must say WHICH DEFECT CLASS
//      goes unwatched, not merely that the check is expensive. The live models
//      are already in the tree — `tutorial-reach` and `release-shots`, each named
//      in a boundary that says what is not being watched. Practice generalized,
//      not teeth invented.
//   G3 EVERY DECLARED HOME WAS READ — a home that vanishes, or a workflow whose
//      shape the reader does not recognise, is exit 2 (`unknown`, which blocks),
//      never a quietly smaller census.
//   G4 AN INVOCATION'S EXIT STATUS IS NOT SWALLOWED — IN A SHELL GATE LIST ONLY.
//      Vira's close, and the one check here about a GREEN tree. `node
//      tools/x.mjs || true` is still an invocation by (1) — the parser sees it,
//      the tool is `listed`, every census is happy — and it is SILENT. So an
//      invocation may not sit on the left of `||`, be followed by `; true`, run
//      under `set +e`, or sit in a step marked `continue-on-error: true`.
//      ⚠ THE VENUE IS NARROW AND THE NARROWING IS THE HONEST PART. JAVASCRIPT
//      gate lists are NOT audited: an ignored `spawnSync` result or a
//      `try { execFileSync(...) } catch {}` stays `listed` and this tool says
//      nothing. AND ITS OWN HOME IS ONE OF THEM — this file is run from
//      tests/run-node.mjs, so the check built to ask "does this list listen?"
//      is deaf in its own venue. The first version of G4 did not say so and
//      counted JS invocations in its own denominator, which made the claim
//      general while the coverage was not (reviewer P2 at 11ec9ab).
//      Closing it honestly needs dataflow, not a heuristic — the suite's own
//      pattern is try/catch -> `{ code }` -> an accumulator -> process.exit() —
//      and a near-enough rule would be this file committing the defect it
//      exists to name. So it is REFUSED BY NAME, in the tool's own output,
//      every run. The red arrives the day someone builds it.
//      Also not detected, in either venue: a pipeline that masks status
//      (`cmd | tee`) and a wrapper script that exits 0 on its own.
//
// REPORTED, NOT ASSERTED — and it carries its removal condition on its face,
// because an excuse that outlives its defect is how a suite goes green over a
// bug (Law 5's own lesson, learned on `axisfit`):
//   THE CENSUS — how many tools sit in each state. WHETHER a tool ought to be
//   wired is a design call with real costs; D78 rules the default disposition is
//   `excluded-with-a-reason`, and that a wiring spree buys the APPEARANCE of
//   coverage with a browser budget. That call is not this file's.
//   ⚠ IT BECOMES AN ASSERTION the day those dispositions are filed — then every
//   tool has a state by somebody's hand, `unlisted` is a defect, and whoever
//   files the last one DELETES this paragraph rather than softening it.
//
// KNOWN-BAD FIRST (development.md, *The instrument rule*). `--selftest` plants
// its known-bads as FILE BYTES in a copied real tree (tools/doorplant.mjs) and
// runs this tool whole from the copy. Two of the plants are ones I personally
// owe: an invocation moved into an `echo` (the mistake I made), and `|| true` on
// a real step (the property I claimed and did not have).
//
// Usage:
//   node tools/gatelist.mjs              the verdict, with the census
//   node tools/gatelist.mjs --raw        every tool, one row per line
//   node tools/gatelist.mjs --browser    only the launchBrowser callers
//   node tools/gatelist.mjs --selftest   the same-door known-bad corpus
// Exit: 0 assertions hold · 1 a finding · 2 a home could not be read (unknown)
//
// REMOVAL CONDITION (SOP 1's corollary): deleted the day SOP 14 §5a is cut —
// §5a is scaffolding for a missing generator and this is the generator, so they
// die together. Also WRONG, AND REWRITTEN, the first time this reports `listed`
// for a tool a gate does not actually execute: then command position was never
// the thing that knew.
