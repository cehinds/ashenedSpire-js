//   node tools/ai-disclosure.mjs             print the Steam disclosure field text
//   node tools/ai-disclosure.mjs --full      print the whole in-product text
//   node tools/ai-disclosure.mjs --evidence  print the verbatim commands a sceptic runs

//
// WHY THE SEARCH PATTERNS LIVE HERE AND NOT BESIDE THE CLAIM. The disclosure
// module names the AI vendor it discloses, so a pattern stored there matches its
// own text: our own falsifier came back red on a clean tree, twice, in the one
// document where credibility is the product (Sunna's D-S1 — she blocked the
// branch for it and she was right). This file is outside src/, so nothing it
// searches contains it.
//
// Zero dependencies, Node core only.
