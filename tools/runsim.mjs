// tools/runsim.mjs — headless FULL-RUN simulator (M3 acceptance: "all 3
// classes can complete 3-act runs").
//
// Plays whole seeded runs — map path → encounters → combats → rewards →
// shrines/events/treasure → act bosses → Acts 1-3 — using the same naive
// greedy bot as the tests (leftmost affordable card, first living target),
// with a simple pilot for run decisions:
//   path: prefer a shrine node when hurt, else first reachable;
//   rewards: always take the first card; elite/boss relics accepted;
//   shrine: rest when below 60% HP, else smith (upgrade first unupgraded);
//   merchant: skipped (no purchases); events: first affordable choice
//   (startCombat consequences are fought); treasure: take the relic.
//
// This is a completability floor, not a balance target: the bot can't pilot
// combos or curate a deck. Any full-run crash = a real integration bug.
//
// Run: node tools/runsim.mjs [runsPerClass=30] [--endless] [--incoming] [--level-stat=<attr>]
//   --endless: Endless Spire mode — acts loop past 3 with per-cycle scaling
//   (capped at act 15 here); reports climb depth instead of win rate.
//   --seeded-seats: draw the seat order per seed (SPEC §13.4) instead of the
//   default order. Off by default so the win-rate corpus keeps comparing the
//   same climbs it always measured (§13.6); on, it measures every order — the
//   distribution a real run draws, and the one balance.bossTiers is tuned on.
//   --selftest: the CI rung's own integrity (FINISH §3, *A headless full run in
//   CI*). Plants a throw inside a card's resolution, a fight that never advances and a map
//   whose path never reaches its boss, and requires each to exit 1 with a
//   CRASH or SOFT-LOCK line; then requires a clean fleet to exit 0 and two
//   fleets on the same seeds to print the same report.
//   --plant=<fight-throw|combat-stall|map-cycle>: one of those plants alone.
//   --step-budget=<n>: map nodes an act may walk before it is a soft-lock
//   (default: the act map's own node count — a path visits one node a floor,
//   so a walk longer than the map has nodes is going round in a circle).
//   --mana-ab: the Mana-aware A/B (SPEC §5.5.1, a release gate). The fleet runs
//   twice on the same seeds, Mana OFF then ON, and prints each class's win rate
//   and mean Mana spent per run for both arms. OFF waives the Mana line at the
//   bot's door (see MANA_ON below); ON is the shipped game.
//   --seat-tiers: per tier (SPEC §13.3), how many runs reached it and how many
//   cleared it, per class and per seat, beside the configured balance.seatTiers
//   and balance.bossTiers rows (read from content, never restated here).
