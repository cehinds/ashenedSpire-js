// tools/sfx-loudness.mjs — deterministic A-weighted loudness of every SFX
// recipe, computed from the table rather than rendered (#66, Sunna's mix gate).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The render-based probe that found the frost defect
// (gamedesign/sunna/log/2026/probes/sunna-proc-meter2.mjs, family repo) drives
// a real OfflineAudioContext through a headless browser — the truest signal we
// have, and the right instrument to FIND a defect. But its sting is scheduled
// inside a suspend/resume pump, and measured on one unchanged tree it returned
// -37.0, -41.2, -47.0, -49.2 and -999 dBFS for the SAME recipe across runs:
// when the schedule slips, the analysis window catches part of the sting or
// none of it. A miss can only LOSE energy, never add it, so its lows are
// artifacts — but a 12 dB spread cannot support a 0.6 dB claim, and I will not
// tune a mix against a number I cannot reproduce twice.
//
// So this tool computes the same quantity ANALYTICALLY from the recipe rows:
// no browser, no scheduler, no randomness, identical every run. It is less
// true than a render (it models the envelopes rather than observing them) and
// it is exactly reproducible, which is the trade that makes it useful for
// TUNING. Find with the render; tune against this; confirm by ear.
//
//   node tools/sfx-loudness.mjs              every recipe, loudest first
//   node tools/sfx-loudness.mjs --family procBurst   one family, with spread
//   node tools/sfx-loudness.mjs --selftest   known-bad: prove it can go red
//
// THE MODEL, stated so it can be argued with:
//   tone  — energy = peak^2 * (dur/2), A-weighted at the geometric mean of
//           freq and `to` (a glide's perceptual centre is nearer the log
//           midpoint than the arithmetic one). The /2 is the exponential
//           gain envelope's mean-square over its life.
//   noise — energy = peak^2 * (dur/3), spread across hp..lp, A-weighted by
//           integrating the curve over that band in log steps. /3 because
//           noise() sets its peak at onset and decays from there, so its
//           mean-square is lower than a tone that ramps up and back down.
// Both are approximations of the SAME shape for every row, so COMPARISONS
// between rows are the claim; absolute dBFS is not.
//
// REMOVAL CONDITION (SOP 1's corollary): deleted the day the render probe is
// stable enough to tune against — one instrument beats two, and the render is
// the truer one. Until then this is the only re-runnable number a mix edit can
// be checked against.
