// tools/hudbars.mjs — does the HUD bar's LENGTH actually track the maximum?
//
// Constantine, 2026-08-08: "the size of that bar should scale depending on the
// max total. much like elden ring's hud". That is a claim about how the HUD
// behaves ACROSS maxima, and no reading at one maximum can support it — every
// scale, and every constant, looks identical at a single value. So this tool
// exists to vary the maximum and watch the bar.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT IT ASSERTS
//
//   A1 TRACKING     Sweep real maxima through the run's own maxHp and require
//                   the rendered trough width to be STRICTLY MONOTONE in max.
//                   This is the assertion that catches a constant-width bar.
//   A2 PROPORTION   PER RESOURCE (his word, 2026-08-13: "bar scaling per
//                   resource" — family repo directions.md D19 C6). For EACH
//                   resource with a door — hp via ?shotMaxHp, mana via
//                   ?shotMaxMana, stamina via ?shotMaxStamina — width/max is
//                   constant across that resource's own sweep (linear scale)
//                   within tolerance, over the points that are neither floored
//                   nor above the resource's own derived domain. The at-domain
//                   point is ON the line (max/domain = 100 % exactly) and is
//                   included. A resource with fewer than two usable points at
//                   a shape says so by name; fewer than two at EVERY shape is
//                   red, not silence.
//   A2X CROSS-RES   The NEGATIVE CONTROL the per-resource ruling demands:
//                   (a) two resources standing at different maxes MUST render
//                   different px-per-point — under the dead shared-rate
//                   alternative (Elden Ring's literal read) they must not,
//                   which is exactly why this asserts they DO; and (b) a
//                   resource AT its own derived domain fills its OWN cell —
//                   the clause a shared-scale regression cannot pass even
//                   when the 16 px floor masks (a), because 2/91 of a mana
//                   cell floors while 2/3 of it does not.
//   A3 CEILING      A bar at its own domain maximum must fill its derived cell
//                   (his "max size filling up the full top row"), and no bar may
//                   ever exceed it. The cell is MEASURED off the bar's own
//                   containing block, never typed — since the hybrid HUD
//                   (2026-08-13) that is the .restrack beside the label plate,
//                   and two banded bars on one line do not share a track.
//   A4 NO COLLISION The visible label must fit the box that holds it, at every
//                   max in the sweep. Hybrid units: the plate must not clip its
//                   own text (the reserve or a degradation stage is missing).
//                   Strip/legacy bars: the label must not outgrow its trough —
//                   Marina rendered maxMana = 2 at 48 px and watched "MANA"
//                   collide with "1/2"; this is that finding, mechanised.
//   A5 TAP FLOOR    Law 4 — the two top-row buttons stay at or above the floor.
//                   The bars must not push them under it.
//   A6 FLOOR MARK   Every bar the minimum-width clause caught must carry the
//                   broken-axis mark. A floored bar is no longer to scale, and
//                   one that does not say so is the lie the clause exists to
//                   prevent.
//   A11 PLAYER VESSEL  D10.4 — "poise (very skinny bar) under the health bar",
//                   and "the hud under the character models should really just
//                   show health and poise" (his words, 2026-08-08; the player
//                   half ruled answered by D17 q5, 2026-08-08, over the mock's
//                   silence). On the default pose: (a) the main HUD carries a
//                   poise bar whose data-max EQUALS the posed combat entity's
//                   own poiseMeter.max (DOM ↔ model, never a typed number),
//                   whose data-cur is 0 — the VALUE has no writer; the vessel
//                   is real-but-empty, and this asserts the emptiness rather
//                   than hiding it — and whose trough renders STRICTLY LOWER
//                   than the hp trough ("very skinny" is a rendered fact, not
//                   a stylesheet intention: the main-surface height rule
//                   outranks .resbar-skinny by specificity, so only a
//                   measurement can claim this). (b) the player's under-model
//                   strip shows EXACTLY hp and poise. (c) THE REFUSAL EDGE:
//                   ?shotMaxPoise=0 removes the vessel — the bar is ABSENT,
//                   not an empty trough, while hp stands. (d) poise's A2 sweep
//                   stands AT its own derived domain and must fill its own
//                   cell there (same clause as A2X (b), poise's copy).
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// HOW THE KNOWN-BAD ENTERS — and it enters by the real door, with no fixture.
//
// The house's amended instrument rule (development.md): a known-bad handed to
// the function under test, downstream of the load and render the real input
// travels through, exercises the half that was never in doubt. Eleven
// instruments in one session ran dead and printed a plausible number.
//
// THIS TOOL'S KNOWN-BAD IS THE SHIPPED TREE. Before this change, the combat
// health bar was `.topbar .hpbar { width: 19rem }` — A CONSTANT. It rendered
// the same length at 72 max HP and at 250. That is precisely the defect A1
// asserts against, it is real code that really shipped, and it needs nothing
// authored to produce it:
//
//     node tools/hudbars.mjs --tree <a checkout at dev=08e184a>   → A1 RED
//     node tools/hudbars.mjs --tree <this branch>                 → A1 GREEN
//
// THE HYBRID ASSERTIONS WERE ALSO WATCHED RED BY THE SAME DOOR (2026-08-13,
// each planted as a scratch stylesheet edit, rebuilt, swept via ?shotMaxHp,
// then reverted — never committed):
//   typed-constant trough (width: 40% !important)  → A1 "2 distinct widths",
//       A2 78.8 % spread, A3 30.84 px of a 77.11 px cell — all RED.
//   over-wide plate reserve (min-width: 30ch)      → A4 "plate clips its own
//       label" RED on every bar, both shapes.
//   the un-reserved plate itself (commit d2e61aa)  → A1 RED: max 88 -> 120
//       shrank the bar 92.91 -> 88.53 px, because the label's digit count was
//       moving the trough's track. That observation is why the plate reserve
//       exists (resbars.js) and why A2 deliberately reads RAW px, never
//       cell-normalised — normalising would have hidden exactly this defect.
//
// THE PER-RESOURCE MIGRATION WAS ALSO WATCHED RED FIRST (2026-08-14, with the
// D19 C6 ruling; plant a scratch edit to resourceBarPlan, rebuilt, swept by
// ?shotMaxMana/?shotMaxStamina, then reverted — never committed):
//   shared cross-resource rate (every row divided by the surface's LARGEST
//   domain, 91, instead of its own) → mana and stamina floored at 16 px at
//   EVERY point of both sweeps on both shapes (A2 "fewer than two usable
//   points at every shape" ×2, RED); mana AT its own domain rendered 16 px
//   floored of its own cell — 21.78 px at 390x844, 5.81 px at 320x640
//   (A2X (b), RED both shapes); no shape offered an unfloored hp+mana pair
//   (A2X (a) premise dead, RED). And the number that justifies the whole
//   migration: hp STAYED GREEN under that plant — 91 IS the shared max, so
//   the pre-migration hp-only A2 could not see this class at all. 21 failing
//   planted; 18 ok after revert, same door.
//
// A11 WAS WATCHED RED BY BOTH OF ITS DOORS (2026-08-14, with the vessel):
//   the SHIPPED PRE-VESSEL TREE (dev = acb8ffe, real code, nothing authored)
//   → 5 FAILING: no player poiseMeter, model strip [hp] only, both shapes,
//   plus A2 "poise: fewer than two usable points at every shape" — which is
//   what the usableByResource seed below exists for: without it, a tree whose
//   model derives no poise domain skipped the sweep in SILENCE.
//   the shared-rate plant re-run WITH poise aboard (same scratch edit as
//   above, rebuilt, reverted) → 23 FAILING, and the row that matters: poise
//   at its OWN domain 33 rendered 25.42/39.55 px of its cell (A11 (d), RED
//   both shapes) while hp STAYED GREEN — poise's domain (33) differs from the
//   shared max (91), so the vessel's at-domain clause sees exactly the class
//   the hp sweep is structurally blind to. The control lives on the resource
//   whose domain does NOT equal the shared value; keep it there.
//
// The maximum enters through `?shotMaxHp=`, which writes `run.maxHp` — the same
// field a curse (engine/actions.js:549) and an armour mod (model/loadout.js
// runMods) write. It is not injected into the renderer. Every stage the real
// number travels — run creation, combat entity creation, the paced snapshot,
// the resource table, the plan, the DOM — runs exactly as it does in play.
//
// AND THE DENOMINATOR IS GUARDED ON EVERY RUN, not behind a flag. A1 fails if
// the sweep produced fewer than MIN_POINTS distinct rendered widths: measuring
// one maximum N times is how a sweep goes dead, and this repo has done exactly
// that (a sweep that measured one seed 24 times, 2026-08-08). The DOOR line at
// the foot of every run says where the input entered.
//
//   node tools/hudbars.mjs                  → the sweep, human table
//   node tools/hudbars.mjs --falsifier      → Law 0: one reader + one row, zero UI
//   node tools/hudbars.mjs --scales         → what a curved transpose would do
//   node tools/hudbars.mjs --model-scale    → every enemy, if the under-model
//                                             surface scaled by max
//   node tools/hudbars.mjs --tree DIR       → measure another checkout
//   node tools/hudbars.mjs --json out.json
//   node tools/hudbars.mjs --selftest       → plant each arm's known-bad by the
//                                             real door, require the named red,
//                                             revert, and prove the tree clean
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE ARMS THAT HAD NO WATCHED RED UNTIL 2026-08-15 — and why --selftest exists.
//
// Everything above records a red somebody watched: A1/A2/A2X/A3 by the typed-
// constant and shared-rate plants, A6 and A6W by the dead-floor plants, A11 by
// the pre-vessel tree. A4 and A5 had NONE. They have asserted green on every run
// of this tool's life, and a green nobody has watched go red is `unknown`, not
// green (development.md, *The instrument rule*) — Vira's doors audit put this
// whole file in the SAME-DOOR column on the strength of the arms that WERE
// watched, which is the neighbour-inheriting-the-green shape, in my own tool.
//
// So --selftest plants each of them, and the plant is a REAL EDIT TO A REAL
// SHIPPED FILE, rebuilt through launch.mjs and re-rendered — the same door the
// stylesheet and the content table enter by. Nothing is handed to judge().
// Each arm restores its file in a finally and rebuilds, then the run ends with a
// CLEAN CONTROL: the unplanted tree must produce zero fails, or a red that never
// goes green is not a measurement either.
//
// AND EACH ARM PRINTS WHAT STAYED GREEN. That is not decoration: the dead-floor
// plant (2026-08-14) went red on two assertions while every other one stayed
// green, and that silence is the whole argument for watching each arm on its
// own rather than trusting a suite's total.
//
// STILL UNWATCHED AFTER THIS ACT — A7, A8, A9, A10, and they are named here
// rather than quietly left, because an instrument that hides its own gaps is the
// thing this whole batch was called to fix:
//   A7 mana identity · A8 co-op seat identity — each HAS a declared negative
//     control (proveManaNumericDriftFails, proveAnonymousLabelFails,
//     proveMissingSeatIdentityFails) and each is DOWNSTREAM by construction: a
//     hand-built object goes straight to the judging function, below the render
//     and the read the real defect would travel through. They are honest about
//     being controls; they are not same-door known-bads.
//   A9 battlefield crop · A10 co-op action floor — NO control of any kind.
// All four run only under --shots, which serves the source tree and writes PNGs,
// so planting them needs the capture path driven from the selftest as well as a
// plant. That is a second act, not a line. Until it is done these four arms are
// `unknown`, not green, and this comment is the debt — not a note in a log
// nobody greps. (Freja, 2026-08-15. The same discipline as flaskSeed's unwaked
// refusal: say the gap in the instrument's own home, do not force a plant that
// would prove the half that was never in doubt.)
//
// BOUNDARY, printed on every run including the clean ones: headless Chromium on
// Linux, dist/AshenSpire.html, the shapes listed below, the reaver class, one
// seed. It says nothing about Windows, about a real finger, about whether the

// Each arm is a real defect this repo can actually ship, planted in the file
// that would really carry it, and it travels the whole road: source edit →
// launch.mjs rebuild → dist/AshenSpire.html → headless render → the same READ
// and the same judge() the standing run uses. The plant is NEVER handed to a
// function; there is no fixture in this block, only files.
//
// One shape (320x640) per arm, deliberately and stated in the output: it is the
// narrow edge where a label runs out of room, so it is the shape both arms are
// about. The standing run judges both shapes; this proves the assertion can
// fire, not that it fires everywhere.
const MUTANTS = Object.freeze({
  // A4 — THE LABEL COLLIDES WITH ITS OWN BOX. The real class, in A4's own
  // words, is "the degradation stage for this width is missing": the plate
  // shows its widest variant at a width that variant does not fit. This plant
  // is the one-line cleanup that causes it — force the full name+numbers on at
  // every width, exactly what deleting or mis-editing the container-query block
  // does. The reserve only applies inside the 6.75em window, so the widest
  // label lands in a plate that never reserved room for it.
  // WHERE THE STAGE LIVES NOW: the plate is the kit's Meter (styles/kit.css
  // § METER) and its degradation rung is a container query that drops the label
  // under 9rem of the meter's own inline size, not three `.l-*` variants in
  // combat.css. A4's claim is unchanged
  // — the VISIBLE label must fit the box that holds it — so the plant is a plate
  // whose box is too small for the label it is still showing.
  // TWO AIMS THAT DID NOT FIRE, recorded so the next person does not spend the
  // night I did. (1) Deleting the rung (`display: inline !important` inside the
  // container query) changes nothing at 320x640: the shipped labels there are
  // HP/MP/SP and the meters are not under 8em, so the rung is not the thing
  // holding that shape together. (2) A 3.4rem label does not clip either — the
  // plate is a flex item with no fixed width, so an oversized label STEALS ROOM
  // FROM THE TROUGH instead of overflowing (which is P4/P5's subject in
  // tools/hudparity.mjs, not A4's). A fixed narrow plate is the edit that puts
  // the label in a box it cannot fit — the shape a reserved column gets written
  // as — and it reds A4 at every bar (measured: hp "HP 40/40" 26.77 px in 12 px,
  // 6 findings at 320x640).
