// tools/screen-census.mjs — every player-facing screen in the tree, and what
// watches it. Rune, 2026-08-07, on Marina's ruling of the same day.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. Constantine asked three times for a status checklist. The
// family's rule is that a third ask means the need is standing and it gets a
// DERIVED tool — because a hand-kept status page is the frozen-baseline defect
// pointed at the one artifact he actually reads, and we killed four of those in
// a day. So: nothing here is typed. Every line is read out of the tree, or is a
// POINTER to the one home that holds the fact, and each line says which.
//
// ONE CENSUS, TWO CONSUMERS (Marina's ruling, and it is the whole shape).
//   "What exists and who has watched it" is a CENSUS      — derived, and it is this file.
//   "Is it fit to ship"                  is a JUDGEMENT   — Sten's, against his datum,
//                                                           commons/release-floor.md.
// Two tools counting screens separately would be the second copy this one exists
// to kill. So this file counts screens ONCE and offers the floor a row it can
// cite; it does not grade anything.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT COUNT, on purpose. Top-level `?shot=` states and the
// navigable sub-surfaces (menu tabs, settings categories, armoury views) are
// counted by tools/release-shots.mjs and tools/surfaces.mjs. Those are their
// homes and this tool RECOUNTS NEITHER — it reads release-shots the way it reads
// every other instrument: as a file that either names a screen or does not.
//
// THE UNIT IS A SCREEN MODULE, and its home is the DIRECTORY. `src/ui/screens/`
// is a real single home: a file is there because it is a screen. No registry, no
// list, nothing to keep in sync — which is also what makes a new screen free
// (see CLAUSE 7 at the bottom).
//
// THREE STATES, because a checkbox implies existence and a binary flattens the
// honest middle (Marina):
//   [x]  built, and at least one instrument reaches it
//   [~]  built, and NOTHING in tools/ or tests/ reaches it — nobody has watched it work
//   [ ]  designed, not built — NOT DERIVABLE FROM A TREE. Paper leaves no trace
//        in src/. This tool prints the pointer to its home and refuses a count.
//
// THE HONEST LIMIT OF [x], said here rather than discovered later: a name in an
// instrument's SOURCE is not a run. This census proves an instrument KNOWS HOW
// TO REACH a screen; it does not prove the instrument still starts, still passes,
// or ever opened it. `release-shots` failed to start for a whole day while every
// name in it was still there. [x] means "something has a way in", never "it works".
//
// Usage:  node tools/screen-census.mjs [--selftest] [--raw]
// Exit:   0 the census was taken · 1 a finding · 2 the harness could not run
//
// REMOVAL CONDITION: delete this file the day `src/ui/screens/` stops being where
// screens live — the denominator would then be a guess, and a guessed denominator
// is what this tool was built to refuse.

  // unwatched and the report is a confident, total lie.
  //
  // FLOORED PER SOURCE, NEVER ON THE AGGREGATE. The finding is VIRA'S, gating
  // this file on 2026-08-08; the reason it is worth a paragraph is that I had
  // floored the TOTAL and wrapped each directory's walk in `catch { return [] }`,
  // so losing ONE of the two sources was silent. Reproduced by me on a synthetic
  // two-screen tree before adopting it — `tests/` moved aside, `tools/` emptied,
  // both directions:
  //
  //     2 modules · 1 reachable · 1 by nothing · 0 findings · EXIT 0
  //     "THE [~] LIST … Nobody has watched these work:  beta"
  //
  // and `beta` was watched, by the file the census had just stopped reading.
  // THAT IS A FALSE CLAIM ABOUT THE GAME, PRINTED AT EXIT 0, CAUSED BY A DEFECT
  // IN THE CHECK — the worst thing an instrument can do, in the tool written to
  // stop instruments doing it. The only trace was `1 instrument files read` in
  // the header: a bare number with nothing to compare it against.
  //
  // Why it survived my own known-bad corpus: the plant I wrote emptied BOTH
  // directories, so the floor had been watched going red and read as observed.
  // The case that actually happens is one step smaller — a renamed directory, a
  // partial checkout, a clone made narrow. A plant that fires does not prove the
  // floor is at the right HEIGHT.
  //
  // It adds no baseline and no frozen constant: zero is derived every run, not
  // remembered. (Vira's queue-properties.md P1, written about a queue on the 7th
  // and landing on a census on the 8th.)
  //
  // TWO FAILURES, NOT ONE, and the second is the one my `catch` swallowed: a
  // source can come back EMPTY, or it can THROW. A directory that is GONE throws
  // — which is exactly how I reproduced it — so the throw path gets its own
  // named fatal and its own plant, rather than sharing the empty one's.
  //
  // SELF-EXCLUSION, and the first thing this tool caught was itself. The very
  // first run printed `[x] shop — 1 · screen-census`, on the strength of the
  // comment eleven lines above identRe() reading "`mountShop` must not match
  // `shop.js`". A sentence written to prevent a false match WAS one. Two
  // reasons it is excluded rather than tidied: this file opens no browser and
  // mounts nothing, so it can never be what watched a screen work; and a census
  // that may cite itself is a self-confirming green — the purest form of the
  // lying instrument, in the tool whose whole job is to not be one.

// on — was derived at the join and dropped here, so a reader was handed a
// FILENAME and no way to check it. She reproduced this tool's own first bug on a
// fresh tree with one comment reading "this tool deliberately does NOT touch
// mountBeta", and got `[x] beta 2`. I reproduced it too, on my own synthetic
// tree, with the same sentence. A comment saying a tool does not touch a screen
// still counts as the tool touching it — my self-exclusion fixed the INSTANCE
// and left the CLASS, and the class is one file away in any tree.
//
// Printing the token does not prevent a false match. It makes one FINDABLE by
// whoever reads the report, which is the whole of the ask.
//
// AND THIS IS WHY IT IS EXTRACTED RATHER THAN INLINED. Vira planted the property
// on the MODEL — every `watchers[].why` non-empty — and wrote that its falsifier
// was "delete `why` from the join, OR STOP PRINTING IT". The second half does not
// hold, and I checked before adopting rather than after: with her print reverted
// to the bare filename in her own clone, her corpus still reads 10/10 red and
// `[x] map 7` still prints `contrast-audit · mapreach · …`. A property planted on

// three source plants landed above, which is how I know it is not hypothetical.
