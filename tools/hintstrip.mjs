// tools/hintstrip.mjs — THE COMBAT ACTION ROW SITS UNDER THE CARDS, WHOLE, AND
// STAYS THERE WHEN A KEY LABEL GETS WIDER. The rendered check on the row that
// carries combat's controls and their key labels.
//
// ── THE SUBJECT MOVED, AND THIS GATE FOLLOWED IT (#527, 2026-09-02) ─────────
// The contextual hint strip this tool was written for is RETIRED on the combat
// screen: 82adffc6 (2026-08-30, the five-cell command rail) made
// `.hand-area > .hint-bar.hint-combat { display: none }` because the action row
// (`.combat-action-row`, UI.combatActionRail) carries its own direct controls
// and key labels — END TURN prints its binding as `<kbd class="et-key">`. The
// element is still in the DOM, hidden by that rule, on purpose. The gate kept
// asking for the strip and, the first time it ran hosted (run 297), reported an
// EMPTY population at every wide cell and two of its six plants patched CSS
// that no longer existed. Everything below now measures the ROW: the invariant
// is the same sentence — under every card, whole, on screen, touching no other
// combat furniture, surviving a wide rebound label — said of the element that
// ships. The retired strip is treated as furniture: if it ever renders again on
// combat, the row must not touch it, and that is measured rather than assumed.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. His words, 2026-08-17, with a screenshot of the strip:
//   "this should be at the bottom under the cards, not over lapped by the cards.
//    perhaps shift the cards up a bit to make space for this tool tip."
//
// ⚠ HIS PREMISE WAS HALF WRONG AND THE MEASUREMENT IS KEPT HERE RATHER THAN
// SMOOTHED AWAY. Before the fix, at dev = db09846, over eight wide shapes
// (1200x730, 1200x600, 1366x768, 1440x900, 1920x1080, 1024x640, 900x560,
// 800x600) the strip touched **0 of 5 cards at every one** — and was **100% of
// its own area inside the TOPBAR at every one**, a bar the old CSS comment
// called "the 5.2rem topbar" and which measures 141 local px. What the pill
// really sat on was the POISE track. On both narrow shapes it was
// `display: none` and occluded nothing because it did not exist.
// So: the element he pointed at was right, the direction was right, and the
// occluder was not the one he named. Recorded because a check written to his
// sentence would assert a card overlap that never happened, and pass forever.
//
// AND THE DEFECT THE ASK UNCOVERED, which is the one that was costing a player
// ink: the hand's fan pushed its OUTER cards down by |i-mid| * 6 px, so the
// outermost card's box ended **5.65 local px BELOW .hand and below the viewport**
// — identical to two decimals on all eight wide shapes, so a constant and not
// one window's accident. The cards were clipped at the bottom of the screen
// before the strip ever moved.
//
// WHAT IT CHECKS, per shape, per text size (the "row" is `.combat-action-row`;
// the history below says "strip" where it records what was measured then):
//   H1 BELOW      every card's rendered box is entirely ABOVE the row's top.
//                 Stated as containment, not as a gap: a number the row could
//                 be nudged by is a number the next hand change re-tunes.
//   H2 CLEAR      the row touches NO other combat furniture — the topbar, the
//                 battlefield, and the retired hint strip should it ever render
//                 again. The count is ZERO, not a budget.
//   H3 WHOLE      no control is clipped and nothing overflows: every direct
//                 child of the row (orb, DRAW, END TURN, DISCARD, EXHAUSTED) is
//                 inside the row's box, END TURN's key label is inside END TURN,
//                 and the row's scrollWidth/Height do not exceed its client box.
//   H4 WIDER      H1-H3 again with a REBOUND WIDE LABEL on END TURN. The label
//                 is written through the game's own rebind door — localStorage
//                 keybinds, read by input.js keyLabel() — never by poking the
//                 DOM, so what is measured is a layout under a real binding.
//   H5 ONSCREEN   the row is inside the viewport on every axis, and its own
//                 height is REAL: a row that reserves nothing is how "at the
//                 bottom" becomes "over whatever is at the bottom".
//
// THE NARROW LAYOUT IS MEASURED NOW. The strip was `display: none` there
// (styles/ui.css, #29 slice 0 — keys for hardware a phone has not got) and every
// H-check was `unknown` on narrow by design. The row renders on narrow
// (`:root[data-layout='narrow'] .combat-action-row`, styles/combat.css), so the
// eight declared cells are all measured and nothing is `unknown` by design.
//
// AND THE CARD THAT WAS OWED IS PAID: AN `unknown` BLOCKS. verdict.mjs's rule
// for every other instrument — unknown is never a pass — is this tool's rule
// too: a cell that resolves to `unknown` (the column-overflow branch of H5, or a
// missing subject at a shape this tool did not declare exempt) exits 2. The
// pre-existing column debt that branch was built to refuse to score is
// measured at zero cells today (run 297 and locally), so nothing is painted
// red by this rule that is not a live off-screen control.
//
// THE POPULATION IS DECLARED AND A MISSED CELL IS RED, NOT SILENT. This is my
// own B3 hole from this morning, watched here on purpose: flaskbox printed a
// confident green over "3 expected, 2 reached". Every cell below is counted, the
// expected count is stated, and a shortfall is a finding with its own plant.
//
// THE DOOR: the SOURCE TREE over http in headless Chromium (tools/serve.mjs),
// every box divided back through --ui-zoom into LOCAL px ONCE before anything is
// compared (Law 2's one coordinate space). The text size is set through the
// game's own settings door, not by writing font-size. `--selftest` plants its
// known-bads as file bytes in a copied real tree (tools/doorplant.mjs) and runs
// this whole tool from the copy — same door as every number above.

//   inSituHidden — the control hidden in place (visibility:hidden, no layout
//                  moves), everything else as shipped;
//   uncovered    — the page as shipped with every element painted ABOVE the
//                  control hidden: the control over its own in-situ
//                  background, which is the reference an overlay cannot touch;
//   uncoveredBg  — the same with the control hidden too: the in-situ
//                  background itself;
//   inSituText, uncoveredText — the first and third with the control's text

//                  uncovered, read by the same arithmetic (a cover the
//                  control itself draws over its text — Codex, #540).
// WHAT IS ABOVE THE CONTROL is found by geometry, not by guessing:
// document.elementsFromPoint at a grid of points over the control's box,
// with pointer-events forced to auto on every element for the read (so a
// pointer-events:none sheet is listed too), lists the paint order topmost
// first — everything before the control (or a descendant) and not an
// ancestor of it is drawn over it. Hiding a cover that paints nothing (the
// shipped .fx-layer, an empty positioned wrapper) changes no pixel, so the
// list needs no judgement of what paints.
// `own` is the share of the box where uncovered differs from uncoveredBg: the
// pixels the control paints against its own background. Over those pixels
// the control's UNOBSCURED contribution is |uncovered - uncoveredBg| and it
// DELIVERS |inSitu - inSituHidden| — the same background on both sides, so
// background contrast can neither hide nor invent attenuation (Codex, #540).
// The LOST share is what it fails to deliver, summed by magnitude: a sheet
// at 90% opacity that leaves a tenth of every covered pixel's change loses
// nine tenths, a sheet over a fifth of the control loses a fifth, and with
// nothing painted over the control the two pairs are the same captures and

  // `--waive "<id>,<id>" --waive-card <n>` lands this gate in REPORTING mode for
  // findings that are already known and already carded. Every finding is still
  // measured, printed and named; what changes is only whether these exact ones
  // fail the job.
  //
  // ⚠ READ THIS BEFORE DECIDING IT IS THE THING ci.yml FORBIDS. That comment
  // forbids relaxing a check so a red goes away WHILE THE DEFECT STAYS. The
  // property that separates this from `|| true` is one line and it is machine-
  // checked in both directions:
  //
  //     A WAIVER FAILS WHEN ITS DEFECT DISAPPEARS.
  //
  // Waive a finding that is no longer there and this exits 1 and tells you to
  // delete the waiver. So the excuse CANNOT outlive the defect — which is
  // exactly how `axisfit`'s "reported, never asserted" went quiet over a live
  // bug (Law 5's enforcement note), and I wrote that one. `|| true` and
  // `continue-on-error` sever the verdict from the tree permanently and
  // silently; this stays welded to it, and the weld is what makes the carve-out
  // not a loophole.
  //
  // The four outcomes, and only the first is green:
  //   findings == waived           → 0, printed as WAIVED with its card
  //   a finding NOT waived         → 1, it is new and nobody has judged it
  //   a waived finding is GONE     → 1, DELETE THE WAIVER (the anti-decay edge)
  //   the instrument cannot run    → 2, unknown, unchanged and still blocking
  //
  // The waiver lives in the workflow step, beside the card number, so it appears
  // in the diff that introduces it and in the diff that removes it. It is not a
  // file, because a file is a second home for a fact with a two-week life.
