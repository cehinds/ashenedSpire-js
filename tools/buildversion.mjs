// can do the other's job, and the string used to try to make the digest do

//
// WHAT THE DIGEST COVERS, and it is a closed set stated in one place:
//
//     index.html · styles/** · src/** · assets/** · assets-mobile/** · asset-data/**
//     tools/bundle.mjs · tools/buildversion.mjs · tools/dirorder.mjs
//
// `buildordinal.json` is deliberately OUTSIDE that set — see INPUT_ROOTS for
// the fixpoint that forces it, and rows F and G for the lock that makes it
// safe.
//
// FOUR CONTENT SWEEPS, NOT AN IMPORT WALK, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. tools/bundle.mjs
// discovers its modules by walking `import` from src/main.js. Re-implementing
// that walk here would be a second copy of the one thing this file exists to
// forbid, and it would fail in the silent direction: a module the bundler reads
// and my walk misses is a source change the version does not see. A whole-
// directory sweep cannot miss one. It is over-inclusive instead — an unimported
// file moves the string without moving the game — and over-inclusive is the
// side to be wrong on. src/buildversion.js states that trade in its own words.
//
// THE CONTAINMENT CLAIM IS CHECKED, NOT ASSUMED. `--check` proves player-content
// reads stay inside those four roots. The three small files that decide HOW those
// bytes become an artifact are identity inputs too, without widening the player-
// content/version-site scans into tools/ and their known false positives.
//
// CRLF: canonicalized to LF before hashing, for text files only, decided by
// round-trip rather than by an extension table (a second MIME table is a second
// copy). Without it a Windows checkout of one commit and a Linux checkout of
// the same commit are two different builds — this repo has already paid once
// for a filesystem's opinion reaching a shipped artifact (tools/dirorder.mjs).
//
// BOUNDARY, printed by the tool itself and not only here: a green says the
// version is derived and singly-homed. It says nothing about whether the stamp
// is VISIBLE on any screen — that is ink, not source, and it is
// tools/buildstamp-shot.mjs with a browser.

 * Row B arm 2: a SITE that declares a version — an identifier or object key
 * ending in `version`, bound to a string literal. The caller filters on the
 * key; the VALUE is captured to be REPORTED and is never compared, which is the
 * whole point of the arm.
 *
 * TWO PATTERNS, NOT ONE, AND THE SECOND HALF OF THIS COMMENT IS AN APOLOGY.
 * My first version of this was a single permissive pattern that let a quote sit
 * between the key and the colon, so JSON would fall out for free. Planted and
 * watched on the live tree, it returned TWO false positives:
 *
 *   src/ui/screens/profileNotice.js:81   ...a newer version' : 'We couldn’t...
 *
 * — the last WORD of an English sentence, with a ternary's colon read as an
 * assignment. So the two forms are now written separately and exactly: a bare
 * identifier takes NO quote before its colon, and a quoted key takes quotes on
 * BOTH sides. Prose cannot satisfy either. I had written into row B's own
 * comment that a predicate with standing false positives gets muted, and then
 * shipped one with two — caught only because I planted it instead of reading it.
 *
 * DERIVATION IS NOT A COPY, and that was the other false positive:
 *
 *   src/buildversion.js:104   export const BUILD_VERSION = `${RELEASE}+${SOURCE}`
 *
 * — the canonical composition this whole file exists to protect, reported as a
 * second home for the release. A value is a derivation, not a typed version,
 * when it interpolates and has no digits of its own left once the `${...}`
 * groups are removed. `${RELEASE}+${SOURCE}` reduces to `+` and is derivation;
 * `0.4.0 ${x}` still carries digits and is a copy wearing a template. Testing
 * merely "contains ${" would have been the looser rule and would have opened
 * exactly that hole.
 *
 * ON SCANNING tools/ — AND THIS PARAGRAPH IS A CORRECTION OF MY OWN, MEASURED
 * RATHER THAN REASONED. I first wrote here that row B "cannot be widened to
 * tools/, because a sweep that included tools/ would make this file match
 * itself" — the ai-disclosure trap (Sunna's D-S1: our own falsifier came back
 * red on a clean tree because the file it searched contained the thing it
 * searched for). Then I swept these two patterns over tools/*.mjs and looked.
 * SIX HITS, AND NOT ONE OF THEM IS IN THIS FILE. The stated reason was false.
 *
 * It is false by accident, which is the part worth keeping: the patterns match
 * an identifier, then `\s*`, then a quote — and inside this file's own regex
 * SOURCE the characters `\s*` are a backslash, an `s` and an asterisk, none of
 * which are whitespace. `VERSION_MODULE` and `RELEASE_HOME` are saved by the
 * other half, `/version$/i`, which their names do not satisfy. So the self-match
 * is LATENT, not absent: one ordinary rewrite of either pattern re-arms it.
 *
 * The conclusion survives, on different evidence. Widening to tools/ is still
 * not free — the six hits are `contentVersion: 'x'` twice in
 * profile-durability-probe.mjs, two PROSE values in saveroundtrip.mjs, a log
 * line assembled by concatenation in bundle.mjs, and the plant literal in this
 * tool's own corpus. All six are false positives, and six standing false
 * positives mute a row. Anyone widening this must deal with those AND re-check
 * the self-match, which today holds only by the spelling of a regex.

  // B — NO SECOND COPY OF THE RELEASE. TWO ARMS, AND THE SECOND EXISTS BECAUSE
  //     THE FIRST ONE TURNS AROUND.
  //
  //     ARM 1 — exact string equality with the release, over the files that
  //     reach the shipped artifact. It is right about the defect's BIRTH (each
  //     of palworld's three drifts began as agreement) and it is the only arm
  //     that can see a copy at an UNNAMED site — a bare literal inside a
  //     template with no identifier attached to it. It is kept for that.
  //
  //     ARM 2 — and here is the finding. Equality is a PROXY for copy-hood, and
  //     Bjorn watched the proxy invert, in a copied tree, both ways:
  //
  //         aiDisclosure version '0.4.0'   agreeing → RED
  //         aiDisclosure version '0.4.x'   drifted  → PASS
  //
  //     Red-at-agreement is correct. GREEN-AT-DRIFT IS THE DEFECT: the row
  //     fired while the copy was still harmless and went quiet the moment the
  //     harm landed — two different numbers rendered to a player on two
  //     different screens, and the instrument built to catch exactly that
  //     reporting clean. Marina's MR-251, which generalises it:
  //
  //       An instrument whose predicate is a proxy will invert wherever the
  //       proxy and the subject diverge — and the moment of divergence is
  //       usually the moment of harm.
  //
  //     So arm 2 does not WIDEN the proxy, it REMOVES it. It looks for a SITE
  //     that declares a version — an identifier or object key ending in
  //     `version`, bound to a string literal — and it never reads the value to
  //     decide. A predicate that does not compare the value cannot invert when
  //     the value drifts. The value is reported, never tested.
  //
  //     WHY A SITE AND NOT A SHAPE, measured before it was written rather than
  //     argued: on this tree the site predicate returns 1 hit and it is the real
  //     defect. The obvious alternative — a version-SHAPED literal, /\d+\.\d+/ —
  //     returns 37, of which 36 are SVG stroke widths in src/ui/assets.js and
  //     `"scale"` values in asset-data/equipment/manifest.json. A predicate with 36
  //     standing false positives gets muted, and a muted check is arm 1's defect
  //     again by another route.
  //
  //     Comments are excluded by BOTH arms, unchanged: SOP 5's words are "prose
  //     mention ≠ copy — but the moment anything ASSERTS IT EQUAL to the source,
  //     it's a consumer". A `//` line asserts nothing. The convention is
  //     bundle.mjs's, not a new one, so there is one idea of what a comment is
  //     in this build.
  //
  //     BOUNDARY, and it is a real hole, not a formality: a copy that has BOTH
  //     drifted AND sits at an unnamed site is invisible to both arms — a bare
  //     `Ashen Spire 0.4.x` inside a template literal with no `version` key on
  //     it. Arm 1 cannot see it (the value differs) and arm 2 cannot see it (no

/**
 * whichCommits(digest, root) → ['<short> <subject>', …], newest first.
 *
 * THIS IS THE WHOLE REASON THE VERSION MAY BE A DIGEST INSTEAD OF A REF.
 * src/buildversion.js argues that the stamp must be a fact of the SOURCE and
 * never of the ref, and pays for that with non-orderability, on the promise
 * that you can always ASK THE ARTIFACT: `git log -S'<digest>' -- build/…`.
 * If that command cannot answer, the trade was never paid — the string neither
 * orders nor identifies.
 *
 * IT COULD NOT ANSWER, AND IT FAILED ON THE LIVE BUILD. Measured 2026-08-16 at
 * `dev = a05d071`, whose bundle carries SOURCE `6de9a8b63e`:
 *
 *     git log -S'6de9a8b63e' --oneline -- build/AshenSpire.html   →  (nothing)
 *
 * TWO DEFECTS, one door.
 *
 *   1. MERGES. `git log` does not diff a merge commit at all by default, so the
 *      pickaxe never looks inside one. `6de9a8b63e` entered at `cc5f6dd`, a
 *      merge whose bundle differs from BOTH parents (3b74fd3 and a1a55a5 carry
 *      0 occurrences; cc5f6dd carries 1) — the bundle was re-derived in the
 *      merge act itself, which is this repo's normal way of landing work. So
 *      the tool was blind to exactly the commits that ship builds.
 *      `--diff-merges=first-parent` makes the merge visible.
 *
 *   2. `-S` REPORTS REMOVALS TOO, and the caller's question is not "when did
 *      this string move" but "which commit SHIPPED it". With merges visible,
 *      `--which d20fb1bd4d` returns both `ffdce3c` (added it) and `cc5f6dd`
 *      (replaced it) — one of those two shipped it and the other is the commit
 *      that stopped shipping it. Answering with both is a plausible wrong
 *      answer on a screenshot, which is worse than the silence it replaced.
 *
 * So: PICKAXE TO FIND CANDIDATES, THEN CONFIRM AGAINST THE COMMIT'S OWN BLOB.
 * The pickaxe is a cheap index over 139 bundle-touching commits; the blob read
 * is what makes each line it prints TRUE. A candidate the blob does not confirm
 * is dropped rather than reported.
 *
 * BOUNDARY, and the CLI prints it rather than leaving it here: this searches
 * first-parent history from HEAD. A digest that only ever existed on an
 * unmerged branch is not reachable, and this returns empty rather than
 * pretending the build never existed — the honest answer to "not on this line
 * of history" is not "nowhere".
