// tools/menufit.mjs — the two surfaces a player manages a RUN from: the Armoury
// (equip slots) and the in-run ☰ overlay (deck, stats, settings). Does either fit
// the phone it is opened on?
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Constantine, from his own device: "it's hard to manage equip
// slots and other characteristics from menus due to scaling not auto adjusting
// for mobile screen very well." Sunna measured it and found both halves:
//
//   - THE ARMOURY HID TWO OF SIX WEAPON SLOTS. At 390x844 in the shipped default
//     view the third cell of each hand sat at x 380.55..443.55 in a 390-wide
//     screen — 9.45 px of a 63 px box, with no sideways scroll to reach it. Four
//     cells at Text L/XL. Her note on cause is the whole story: `ui.css` had
//     exactly ONE `data-layout='narrow'` block and it belonged to character
//     creation. The Armoury had never had a phone layout.
//   - THE MENU SHRANK AS THE PHONE SHRANK. `.overlay-modal { max-width: 92vw;
//     height: 74vh }` — vw/vh below <body>, which Law 2 forbids — so the share of
//     the screen it got was 74% x --ui-zoom exactly: 74.0% at zoom 1.0 and 54.8%
//     at 320x640. Auto sizing lowers the zoom as the phone gets smaller, so the
//     smallest phone got the smallest menu.
//
// NEITHER SURFACE IS SWEPT BY ANYTHING ELSE, and that is why this is a new tool
// rather than a clause somewhere. tools/screenreach.mjs reaches only screens with
// a ?shot= state (title, map, combat, boss, death, customize) — the Armoury and
// the overlay are opened by pressing something, so it has never seen either.
// tools/actionreach.mjs asks whether one screen's primary action is on arrival.
// Neither can answer "is the whole surface inside the phone".
//
// WHAT IT CHECKS, per shape x Text size:
//   1. NO EQUIP CELL IS CLIPPED, in EVERY view, not just the one that opens.
//      A cell showing 15% of itself is a control a player can neither read nor
//      reliably hit, and this screen cannot scroll sideways.
//   2. THE VIEW A PHONE OPENS ON is one that fits. Sunna's ruling, and the part
//      of it that is hers: "hybrid must not be what a phone opens."
//   3. THE OVERLAY USES THE SHARE OF THE SCREEN ITS AUTHOR WROTE — height 74%
//      of the app box, within tolerance, at every zoom. This is Law 2 stated as
//      an observable rather than as a grep for `vh`.
//   4. NOTHING IN EITHER SURFACE IS HORIZONTALLY ABSENT.
//   5. TAP TARGETS meet a floor of 44 DEVICE px, measured after --ui-zoom, on
//      the controls this work touches (the overlay tab strip). Sunna's ruling on
//      Law 4 (#37): "a floor of 44 device px measured after zoom; a floor is not
//      a ceiling." Reported for every control, ENFORCED only on the tab strip —
//      widening enforcement is a decision, not a tuning, and it is Marina's.
//
// THE SHAPE LIST IS A CLAIM ABOUT WHERE THE DEFECT LIVES, AND IT WILL BE READ AS
// ONE. Sunna withheld on #36 for exactly this: my previous tool's list stopped at
// 430 while the narrow band runs to ~580, and the sampling's shape became the
// claim's shape. So the widths below are EDGES — the band's bottom, its middle,
// its top (580), the first WIDE shape (600), and desktop — not a comfortable
// handful. It is still not exhaustive and clause (b) of the boundary says how.
//
// Usage
//   node tools/menufit.mjs                  source tree via tools/serve.mjs

//
// OBSERVED RED: run against dist/AshenSpire.html as committed at d027a9a — the
// commit before this fix — this reports FAIL with clipped equip cells at every
// narrow shape and an overlay height share of 74% x zoom rather than 74%. The
// numbers are in the handback; it was watched failing before it counted.
//
// REMOVAL CONDITION: deleted the day screenreach can open a surface that needs a
// press (then clauses 1 and 4 are its job), or the day neither surface exists.

      width — 528x900 is narrow and 540x720 is wide. This list varies width at a
      near-constant height and is SILENT about the other axis. That silence is
      layoutForCap's card (#37 neighbours), not this file's, and it is named here
      rather than left to be discovered.
  (c) LEGIBILITY. It measures whether a control is on screen and how big it is.
      Whether the phone view is a GOOD view is Sunna's call and no number here.
  (d) The ${floorSentence()} device-px floor is ENFORCED only on the overlay tab strip —
      the surface this work touches. Every other control is measured and reported
