// tools/actionreach.mjs — is the way OUT of a screen on screen when the screen
// arrives, and does it STAY there while the player scrolls?
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS, and it is not a hypothetical: the same defect escaped twice
// on the same screen, a week apart, and neither escape was caught by anything
// in tools/.
//
//   - DESKTOP, 2026-07-2x. tools/tutorial-reach.mjs measured "#cz-start lays out
//     at top 1216 in a 1080px viewport, 136px below the fold", wrote the number
//     into a comment, called scrollIntoView, and went green. A tool that
//     measures a defect and then works around it reports PASS forever.
//   - PHONE, 2026-08-01. Sunna measured BEGIN THE CLIMB 374 device px below the
//     fold at 390x844 on a screen that "looks finished" where it stops — no
//     footer, no scroll affordance, 0 px scrollbar gutter — and found it by eye
//     on a shot, not with a tool.
//
// tools/screenreach.mjs cannot see this and SHOULD NOT: its whole load-bearing
// distinction is that SCROLLED OUT is fine and only COVERED is a defect,
// because the act map has 60+ nodes and most are off-screen at any moment.
// Correct there, blind here. This asks the complementary question about ONE
// control per screen: not "can the player reach it if they scroll" but "does
// the player know it is there at all".
//
// WHAT IT CHECKS, per shape x Text size:
//   1. the action is WHOLE on screen on arrival, before any scrolling
//   2. it is still whole after the content is scrolled to its bottom, and
//   3. it did not MOVE while that happened — i.e. it is bounded by flow rather
//      than sitting in the scrollport. (1) alone passes a screen whose button
//      merely happens to fit today's content; (3) is the property.
//   4. nothing on the screen is horizontally absent (EldenSpire#31's property,
//      re-asserted here because this tool visits shapes screenreach does not)
//   5. no wrapped set of equal-weight option cards ends in an ORPHAN ROW — a
//      last row holding fewer items than the row above it.
//
// WIDENED to clause 5 at #29 slice 3, and the widening is deliberate rather
// than convenient: BOTH defects are the arrival screen SAYING SOMETHING FALSE
// ABOUT ITSELF. Clauses 1-3 catch "there is nothing more here" when there is.
// Clause 5 catches "this one is chosen" when it isn't — three class cards
// wrapping 2-then-1 leave a lone centred card under a pair, which is the
// grammar of a selection, while the actually-selected card sat top-left with a
// full card height between the gold border and where the eye lands (Sunna,
// 2026-08-01). A player can check neither claim against anything on the screen.
//
// CLAUSE 5 IS ABOUT THE COUNT, WHICH IS WHY IT IS A CHECK AND NOT A ONE-OFF
// MEASUREMENT. Three cards wrap 2+1 and orphan; four wrap 2+2 and look fine;
// five wrap 2+2+1 and it is back. Law 1 promises a class is a table row, so the
// count is content and moves without anyone touching CSS. The defect returns on
// a data edit, and this is the only thing that would notice.
//
// TEXT SIZE IS NOT DECORATION. Text and line metrics grow, so content can still
// push outward even though the control floor no longer derives from rem. Every
// S/M/L/XL value is read from balance.ui.textSize rather than typed here.
//
// Usage

//   0  every action is whole on arrival and pinned, and no option set orphans
//   1  a finding
//   2  usage / no browser / a screen that would not mount / NOTHING RUN — never a pass
//
// OBSERVED RED (the instrument rule, commons/development.md): run against
// dist/AshenSpire.html as committed at 3da9ca4 — the bundle from the commit
// before the fix — this reports FAIL, 39 findings of 40 cells, exit 1, with
// `moved` equal to the full scroll travel at every failing cell (432 px at
// 390x844 Text M; 1038 px at 430x932 XL). It was watched failing before it was
// allowed to count as coverage.
//
// OBSERVED RED FOR CLAUSE 5, on the widened grid above: run against
// dist/AshenSpire.html as committed at 85edaef — the commit immediately before
// the orphan fix, so clauses 1-4 pass on it EVERYWHERE and the red is the new
// clause and nothing else — this reports FAIL, 23 findings of 60 cells, exit 1,
// every one "#cz-classes .class-pick wraps 2-then-1 (3 items)". The fixed tree
// is PASS 60/60. On the grid this file shipped with FIRST, the same known-bad
// gave 10 of 40 and reported Text L and XL as never orphaning; both numbers are
// superseded, and the older one is left standing in this comment because the
// gap between them is the finding.
//
// THE ONE CELL THAT PASSED ON THE KNOWN-BAD IS THE REASON CLAUSE 3 EXISTS.
// 390x508 at Text size S passed on the old build — the layout flips wide at
// --ui-zoom 0.62 there and the content simply fit, so nothing scrolled and
// nothing moved. Fitting today is not being pinned, and one text size up the
// same cell failed. A tool that only asked clause 1 would have called that
// shape fixed.
//
// REMOVAL CONDITION: delete this file the day tools/screenreach.mjs grows an
// arrival-and-pinned assertion of its own, or the day no family game has a
// screen whose primary action can leave the viewport. Two tools asking one
// question is the second copy this house exists to catch.

//
// THE UPPER NARROW BAND — 480 THROUGH 600 — WAS MISSING, AND A DEFECT LIVED IN
// THE GAP. Corrected at #29 slice 3 review, Sunna gating, and the paragraph two
// above is why it stings: this file warns that a defect can live in the gap
// between two tools' shape lists, and then left a gap inside its OWN list.
// The list stopped at 430 while the narrow layout runs to about 580 (600 flips
// wide) — the bottom quarter of the band it claimed to test. Re-run against the
// same known-bad over the skipped widths, clause 5 goes from 10 findings of 40
// cells to 24 of 48: orphans at Text L at 512/528/560/580 and at Text XL at
// 560/580 — sizes the old list reported as never orphaning at all.
//
// AND IT COST A FALSE MECHANISM, not just missing rows. I wrote that at L/XL the
// cards "were already too wide to pair." They are too wide to pair AT <= 496 px.
// Give the viewport more width and they pair, and orphan, at every text size.
// The shape of the grid had quietly become the shape of the claim.
//
// So the widths below are EDGES, not samples: 480 and 560 (the minimum the
// re-run requires), 512 (where Text L first orphans), 580 (the top of the narrow
// band) and 600 (the first wide shape — the far side of the flip, so the band's
// end is measured rather than assumed).
//
// STILL NOT EXHAUSTIVE, and the reason is worth carrying: layoutForCap fits on
// BOTH axes, so the flip is not a width. Sunna measured 528x900 narrow and
// 540x720 WIDE, 580x900 narrow and 600x900 wide — same widths, opposite answers,
// because the height moved. This list varies width at a near-constant height and
// is SILENT about that. Closing it is layoutForCap's card, not this file's; it is
// named here so the silence is visible rather than absent.

  clicks are not touch. ONE screen is covered (customize) — shop, rest,
  rewards, the overlays and every screen without a scrolling body are covered
  here by nothing. It reads geometry at rest and after a programmatic scroll to
  the bottom: it does not swipe, does not press the action, and cannot judge
  whether the row is legible or whether a player would look for it there.

  THE ON-SCREEN KEYBOARD IS NOT MEASURED AND CANNOT BE. Headless Chromium has
  no OSK, and CDP cannot shrink the visual viewport alone — Emulation.
  setVisibleSize is accepted and silently does nothing, and a viewport clip on
  setDeviceMetricsOverride leaves window.visualViewport untouched (probed, not
  assumed). Shrinking the device metrics reproduces a LAYOUT-resizing keyboard
  exactly, which is why 390x508 is in the shape list; a VISUAL-resizing
  keyboard — the spec default for \`interactive-widget\` — is unknown here, in
  both directions, and 390x508 says NOTHING about it.

  AND THE UNKNOWN IS NARROWER THAN IT WAS FIRST WRITTEN (Sunna, gating #36).
  The action row is \`position: relative; margin-top: auto\` inside an
  \`overflow: hidden\` screen — it is NOT \`position: fixed\`, so calling it "a
  bottom-anchored footer" and reasoning from what those do was asserting a
  mechanism this row does not have. What is measured: it sits at layout-y
  795.41..835 at 390x844 and does not move when the content scrolls. Under a
  visual-resizing keyboard the LAYOUT viewport does not move either, so the row
  stays at that layout coordinate while the browser chooses where the visible
  band sits inside it. Whether the row is on screen while the keys are up, and
  which gesture brings it back, is therefore \`unknown\` — and so is any RANKING
  against the pre-fix build, which was never measured in that mode either.
  "No worse than before" was a comparison of two unmeasured things.
