// tools/swap-cost-relic-surface.mjs — ARM 2 of MR-41 (as amended by MR-46):
// the STARTING-RELIC half of A8 has no presentation anywhere, and this is its
// wake.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT IS MISSING, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE ARMOURY ROW'S JOB
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Constantine, D15/A8: *"switching sets should cost actions. perhaps this
// action costs more or less depending on Talisman OR STARTING RELIC … that way
// I can try each."* Two channels. `swapCostFor()` honours both — it sums a WORN
// delta from `runMods()` and a RELIC delta from `passiveSum()`, sourced in two
// different modules — and the engine charges the total.
//
// The talisman channel now has a surface: the Armoury's comparison prices each
// combat-swappable slot from `swapCostFor()` before and after (MR-41 arm 1,
// tools/equipment-surface-receipts.mjs). THE RELIC CHANNEL HAS NONE, and arm 1
// did not give it one — it cannot. A relic does not change when you slot a
// weapon, so its delta lands identically in `before` and `after` and CANCELS in
// any comparison. That is correct arithmetic, not a bug in the row.
//
// So: author a relic passive tomorrow and the price a player pays changes while
// NOTHING ON ANY SCREEN MOVES. It does not lie. It says nothing — and its
// correct state and its expired state print the same nothing, which is
// precisely the class *The wake condition* (commons/development.md, Freja,
// 2026-08-14) exists for. Absence never fails a test written to expect absence,
// so this file does not test the absence. It tests THE PREMISE.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE WAKE CONDITION, AS AN OBSERVABLE PREDICATE
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
//   PREMISE   — read off REAL shipped content:
//               no relic row authors a `swapCostDelta` passive.
//               It HOLDS while that set is empty; it DIES the day it is not.
//
//   SURFACE   — read BEHAVIOURALLY off the real presentation readers, never by
//               grepping for a word: give one relic a `swapCostDelta` and ask
//               whether any shipped read model's output MOVES. Plus a census of
//               `src/ui/**` for a direct consult of `swapCostFor(` or the
//               `swapCostDelta` passive key, comment-stripped, so a reader I
//               failed to enumerate is not silently missed.
//
//   MARKER    — the paragraph in src/model/equipmentPresentation.js that states
//               this gap, its reason and its discharge condition (MR-45: a
//               structural decision leaves a marker, AND THE MARKER HAS TO BE
//               TRUE OR IT IS AN INVITATION).
//
//   RED, both ways:
//     · WAKE RED   — premise DEAD and no surface. A relic is charging a price
//                    no screen reports. Named relic, named channel.
//     · MARKER RED — a surface EXISTS while the marker still says none does.
//                    The marker has become the false sentence MR-45 is about.
//
// A relic authoring `swapCostDelta` is not a defect. Authoring one while
// nothing shows it is. This file's whole job is to make sure the day those two
// come apart is a day the suite goes red, and not a day six months later when
// somebody counts by hand.
//
// REMOVAL CONDITION (SOP 1's corollary): deleted the day the relic channel gets
// a real surface and the marker comes out with it. There is nothing left to
// watch once the premise cannot die quietly.
