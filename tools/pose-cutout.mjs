//
// WHAT THIS IS FOR. The per-position combat art is generated as full-body
// paintings on a plain off-white backdrop (see the flow named in the evidence
// README). Before any of it can be judged as a SPRITE — on the game's dark
// ground, at the game's scale — the backdrop has to come off. This runs each
// input through the same matte, dye and rim as tools/concept-cutout.mjs, by
// importing them, so a pose and the class sprite it must sit beside were cut by
// the same code. A second matte written here would be the thing that drifts.
//
// TWO MODES. By default it ships NOTHING: output is one PNG per input, cropped
// to the figure with a small margin, plus a sheet of all of them on the game's
// ground so the set can be read at a glance. That is the mode for judging art.

// `--ship` performs the shipping steps this note used to say lived elsewhere —
// frame to 450x570 bottom-aligned at ONE shared scale, dye all five tints,
// encode WebP, and rewrite the class-sprite manifest. It is here and not in
// concept-cutout.mjs because that tool reads the frozen packet's PINNED GIT
// BLOBS by oid: its inputs are a closed set that a pose is not a member of.
// Sharing the framing arithmetic by copying it would have been the second copy;
// sharing it by import is why every frame constant and every pixel routine
// below comes from concept-cutout rather than being restated here.
//
// In `--ship` mode `--in` is a DIRECTORY OF CLASS DIRECTORIES (`reaver/`,
// `starseer/`, ...), each holding the pose to ship, so the class a sprite
// belongs to is the directory's own name rather than a filename convention
// this tool would have to parse and could misread.

/**
 * THE GROUND SHADOW THE EDGE MATTE CANNOT REACH.
 *
 * Every pose is asked for on a plain plate with "no floor, no shadow", and the
 * generator mostly obeys. When it does not, the shadow it paints under the
 * boots is enclosed by the figure's own legs and feet, so the edge flood-fill
 * never arrives at it and the pocket remover sees it as part of the subject.
 * It survives as a pale puddle, which on the game's dark ground is a lamp.
 *
 * A row-based trim is what this looked like it wanted and it is wrong: measured
 * on the Rogue, the shadow spans the same rows as the boots (y 718-745, pale
 * rising 11%->83% and falling back while the lit count stays 120-330), so
 * dropping whole rows takes the feet with them. Per pixel it separates cleanly:
 * at the worst row 260 of 314 lit pixels are pale and the remaining 54 are boot.
 *
 * So the test is per pixel and the same one a matte uses — near-white and
 * nearly colourless — restricted to the foot of the figure, where a shadow can
 * be and where this art keeps nothing pale. It is a NO-OP on a clean source,
 * which is the claim that makes it safe to run on all of them: measured over
 * the same band, the Reaver carries 0-2 pale pixels per row and the Starseer
 * 0-2, against the Rogue's 223.
 *
 * WHY THE THRESHOLDS DO NOT MOVE, and this is the useful part, because the
 * obvious next thought is to widen them. Removing the shadow's pale CORE leaves
 * its soft outer gradient, which the rim then traces as a faint contour on the
 * ground. That gradient sits at max-channel 110-170 — and in exactly that band
 * the CLEAN sources are nearly colourless too: 100% of the Starseer's pixels
 * there and 89% of the Reaver's fall under the 0.22 saturation bar, being boot
 * and leather midtones rather than shadow. Lowering the floor to catch the
 * gradient would therefore punch 140 pixels out of one good pair of boots and
 * 108 out of another. Brightness and colour cannot separate the two at that
 * level, so this cleaner deliberately stops at the core and the remaining
 * contour stays a defect of the SOURCE, fixed by regenerating that plate with
 * the shadow actually suppressed — not by tuning these numbers.
