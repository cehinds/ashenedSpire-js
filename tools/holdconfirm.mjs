// tools/holdconfirm.mjs — THE SECOND BEAT: WHICH ACTIONS TAKE ONE, WHICH FORM,
// AND CAN THE PLAYER STILL GET OUT? (Sunna 2026-08-08; widened by Rune the same
// week, when Marina ruled that which actions take a second beat is a
// CHARACTERISTIC ON THE ACTION and never a list of call sites.)
//
// IT KEEPS ITS NAME AND ITS FILE. The hold's physics are the hardest thing here
// and they already live in this harness; a second tool for "the other beats"
// would be one subject with two instruments, which is the second copy this
// house is named for. What it grew is a SET section and four more surfaces.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR, and it is the one number that would not move. The
// event screen's three choice bars are 44/44/44 across sixteen cells — the SIZE
// was fixed and the miss stayed, because the GAPS are 9-9.7 px at every dial
// setting and nothing in this game reads a gap. A thumb 9 px low lands on the
// neighbour, and on that screen the neighbour is a permanent curse with no
// confirm and no undo. Constantine: "yes press and hold."
//
// WHAT IT MEASURES, with real pointer input dispatched at real coordinates —
// never a synthetic `.click()`, because the whole feature is about which door a
// pointer opens and a synthesised click walks through a different one:
//
//   1. THE ABORT IS THE FEATURE. Press a binding bar, release BEFORE the fill
//      lands. The screen must be unchanged: the bars still there, no result
//      text, nothing committed. THIS IS THE EDGE THAT MATTERS — an early
//      release quietly committing would make the safety step a second way to
//      fire the thing, and it would look identical to working.
//   2. A COMPLETED HOLD COMMITS. Hold past the dial's duration; the result
//      text arrives. A confirm nobody can complete is a lockout, not a guard.
//   3. NOBODY IS LOCKED OUT. Every one of the shipped events must offer at
//      least one UNCONDITIONAL non-binding choice, so a player who cannot
//      perform a hold at all can still leave every event screen. This is the
//      property that makes "the off switch lives on a debug page" safe, and it
//      is checked against the content rather than assumed.
//   4. `off` DISABLES THE HOLD SHORTCUT, NOT THE REVIEW. One tap still opens
//      the same confirmation modal; only that modal may commit the action.
//   5. IT FAILS CLOSED. `--fail-closed` hands the module an op it has never
//      heard of and requires a hold, and prints every opcode the game declares
//      that would now hold. Viki's gate: the first draft enumerated the
//      DANGEROUS ops and defaulted to safe, and its closure was over
//      `RUN_OPCODES` while event effect lists demonstrably leave it. The
//      enumeration was load-bearing where a default should be.
//   6. THE LABEL SURVIVES THE FILL. Bjorn repainted the fill opaque for one
//      frame and the label vanished — `> *` reaches element children and the
//      label is a bare text node, so the line meant to lift it did nothing and
//      only the 0.30 alpha was holding. The fill is a background now, which
//      cannot have that bug, and this asserts the construction rather than
//      trusting the comment.
//   7. THE DERIVATION IS NOT A LIST. `--new-entry` authors a fictional event
//      whose only interesting property is a curse, injects it as CONTENT with
//      no code change, and requires that it arrive holding. That is Law 0's
//      falsifier for this control.
//   8. THE SET IS ENUMERABLE, AND THE PAGE AGREES WITH IT. Every action in
//      `src/model/secondbeat.js` is printed with every cell of every
//      state-dependent row expanded, then held against what the game ACTUALLY
//      DREW, both directions: a declared action that draws no control is a
//      declaration with no handler; a control armed under an id nobody declared
//      is a gap. Neither is visible from a source tree.
//   9. END TURN ALWAYS HOLDS while the dial is enabled — the literal ruling on
//      "same with ending turn". A spent hand does not remove the beat. Off
//      removes the shortcut while preserving the confirmation path.
//  9b. AND THE DIAL IS ONE SWITCH OVER ALL THREE INPUTS. Constantine,
//      2026-08-17: "if hold is toggled, then it should be the same, in all
//      instances. for ending turn, using flask, event choice, shrine rest."
//      Four actions x keyboard and pad x dial on and off, each cell asking BOTH
//      halves — the short press aborts, the long press commits — because either
//      half alone passes against a key that has simply stopped working. Eight
//      cells were RED at b83bda1 and the numbers are printed at that section.
//      This is where the sentence "keyboard/pad activation remains immediate
//      because it cannot be a pointing miss" used to live: it was this tool's
//      own reasoning, it was good, and his word replaced it.
//  10. THE SMITH CONFIRMS, and the confirm carries the preview. #105 shipped
//      that preview as a HOVER tooltip and a phone has no hover, so the touch
//      player's preview was nothing at all. One tap ARMS, CANCEL takes it back,
//      CONFIRM commits — and both answers are measured against the tap floor
//      and against the sideways travel of their own scroll container.
//  11. THE MERCHANT'S BRAZIER, which nobody asked for and which burns a card
//      out of the deck for good on one tap of a small card in a wrapped grid.
//  12. THE BEATS IN THEIR OWN SCREENS' HANDS — the census's `handledBy` rows,
//      which this tool took ON FAITH from the day the set section was written
//      until the three `?shot=` states landed (title / profile / crisis,
//      main.js). Each is driven in its own idiom, because handledBy is an
//      exemption from the shared machinery and not from being watched: the
//      drawer's Restore opens an inline confirm that names what happens to
//      the profile in play; the crisis screen's "Start a new profile" opens a
//      modal, and its commit is read off the save manager's own named state
//      (window.__profile → profileStatus()), never inferred from which screen
//      mounted next. Every pose enters by the real doors: a real profile
//      archived by replacePrimaryWith, real torn bytes read by the real
//      parser. (The title's ✕ was the third of these — a two-click,
//      self-resetting arm — until 2026-08-14, when its row collapsed into the
//      machinery: it holds now, on the dial, and is driven like End Turn on a
//      real save written then listed.)
//
// OBSERVED RED — `--mutate`, and it falsifies the thing that would be silent.
// It puts the OLD DOOR back on every one of the eight armed surfaces: the
// binding bars, End Turn, the shrine's Rest, every Smith candidate, every
// brazier card, the title's ✕, the drawer's Restore and the crisis screen's
// fresh-profile button are rewired so a pointer `click` commits (or looks
// committed) directly, leaving the classes exactly where they are. Each screen
// still LOOKS right and each abort silently commits. EIGHT SEPARATE VERDICTS,
// one per surface, and a run where any one of them fails to go red exits 2 — a
// mutation caught on the event bars and missed on End Turn would have printed
// CAUGHT under one filter, which is a green that proves the wrong thing. A
// guard nobody has watched fail is `unknown`, not green (development.md, the
// instrument rule).

// ---- THE RE-RUNNABLE KNOWN-BAD FOR THE WIDE HOLD (--selftest) ---------------

// `--mutate` above falsifies the POINTER wiring by rewiring the DOM. It cannot
// reach this one: the wide hold lives in ui/input.js and ui/components/
// holdconfirm.js, and a defect there arrives as a SOURCE EDIT. So each plant
// below is exactly that — one contract line replaced in a disposable copy of
// src/, judged by re-running this whole tool at `--root COPY`: real server,
// real boot, real CDP keys, real shimmed pad. Nothing is handed to a function.
//
// EACH PLANT MUST ALSO LEAVE AN UNTOUCHED CORNER GREEN. A plant that craters
// the run proves the tool notices breakage, not that it notices THIS breakage.

  // calls unknown, and unknown blocks. So skips are collected here, named in
  // the verdict, and they take the exit code with them.
  // AND IT SAYS WHICH KIND, which is Vira's answer to my `--accept-skips`
  // question and it is better than the flag I asked for. She refused the flag
  // for a reason worth keeping: A FLAG MOVES THE RECORD OF WHAT WAS NOT ASKED
  // OUT OF THE RUN'S OUTPUT AND INTO THE RUNNER'S COMMAND LINE. The output is
  // what gets pasted into a PR and read a week later; the invocation is not.

  // PERMANENT — no amount of running discharges them — and a gate that is red

    //
    // Every check above this line reads `data-hold-progress`, which is written
    // by the same function that writes `--hold` and is therefore incapable of
    // disagreeing with it. THE DEFECT WAS IN THE PAINT. `base.css` carries a
    // bare `button:hover { background: #2e2517 }` — a SHORTHAND, so it resets
    // `background-image` — at specificity (0,1,1). Renaming `.ev-hold` to
    // `.beat-hold` dropped the fill rule to (0,1,0), under it. A hovering
    // pointer therefore deleted the entire fill while `--hold` climbed
    // perfectly, and YOU CANNOT HOLD A CONTROL WITHOUT BEING OVER IT.
    //
    // So this reads `getComputedStyle().backgroundSize` — the picture — with a
    // MOUSE over the bar, mid-press, and holds it against `--hold`. It is the
    // one check in this file that could ever have gone red on that defect, and
    // it was OBSERVED RED against the branch head before the CSS fix, entering
    // by the same door a player does: the real bundle, a real hover, a real
    // press. dev's `button.ev-choice.ev-hold` (0,2,1) passes it too, which is
    // why the defect was a regression and not a shipped bug.
    //
    // The second half is the ease. `button` also declares
    // `transition: background 120ms` — same shorthand, so `background-size`
    // eases: on dev the paint ran ~13 points behind and GREW on the frame after
    // the finger lifted. That is the one frame the rule's own comment says must

  // ---- THE PANEL MUST BE ON SCREEN — TWO SHAPES, MEASURED ------------------
  //
  // ⚠ THE DEFECT THIS SECTION EXISTS FOR SHIPPED, AND EVERY GREEN IN THIS FILE
  // WAS HONEST WHILE IT DID. At db09846, arming a Smith candidate put both
  // answers below the fold:
  //
  //     390x844   .beat-yes / .beat-no  top 1000.22 .. 1044.22   0% on screen
  //     360x640   .beat-yes / .beat-no  top  938.66 ..  982.66   0% on screen
  //
  // The panel armed, carried its preview, met both tap floors and added no
  // sideways travel — every assertion above this line PASSED — and the player
  // could not see the question. Two cells further up went red only by accident:
  // `pointOf` hands back a centre at y=1022 and a CDP touch there lands on
  // nothing, so `CANCEL takes it back` failed with `panel=true`, which reads as
  // a wiring fault and was a POSITION fault. A tool that finds the right defect
  // for the wrong reason has not measured it.
  //
  // WHY IT IS NOT IN tools/uprightgate.mjs, WHICH OWNS THIS SURFACE. Its clause
  // R gates `unreachable` — nothing on screen and no gesture to it — and this
  // was `scrollable`: `.screen` is `overflow-y: auto` with real travel, so the
  // player COULD reach it by scrolling 156 px that nothing advertised. That gate
  // was GREEN on the defect (24/24 shapes) and is GREEN on the fix, and its
  // `(cut)` lines report the rect either way. **THE INSTRUMENT THAT OWNS THE
  // SURFACE COULD NOT SEE THE DEFECT, AND SAYING SO IS THE FINDING** — it is
  // Vira's file and her clause to widen, not mine to reach into.
  //
  // BOTH SHAPES, AND THE SECOND ONE IS NOT DECORATION. 360x640 is 204 px shorter
  // and puts the panel 299 px down rather than 156; a fix that scrolls the panel
  // but not its buttons would pass at one and fail at the other.
  //
  // WATCHED RED: `--selftest` plant Q7 deletes the `reveal(panel, row)` call
  // from src/ui/components/holdconfirm.js. Both cells go red, in both shapes,
  // with the pre-fix numbers.

  // `off` still demanded two clicks and `long` never lengthened anything. The

  // `?shot=title` state ended that, and the row is machinery now. The table
  // rules `hold` (stakes profile, undo none, hazard pointing — the ✕ shares
  // its row with the slot's own pick control), so the ✕ answers exactly like
  // End Turn: fill under the finger, release-early aborts, the dial is the one
  // home of the duration.

  // — and walks it again after every commit, because a commit closes the
  // selector and re-renders the title. Before this it asked for `.slot-delete`
  // on the first paint, found nothing, and SKIPPED: a beat the game ships,

  (g) NOT THAT THE FORMS ARE THE RIGHT ONES. The table's axis (stakes / undo /
      hazard) is a design claim. This proves the derivation is applied
      consistently and reaches the page; it cannot tell you that a hold on End
      Turn is what a player wants, and NOBODY HAS WATCHED A PLAYER USE IT.
  (h) THE THREE handledBy BEATS ARE MEASURED AS THEY ARE, NOT AS THE TABLE
      DERIVES THEM. shrineLevelUp, profileRestore and freshProfile answer in
      their own screens' hands; this proves each hand works (pends or arms,
      cancels, commits only on the second beat) — whether any should collapse
      into the shared machinery is a design call a green here licenses nothing
      about. (deleteSave was in this club until 2026-08-14; its collapse is
      DONE and its checks above drive the machinery's own hold on the dial.) The crisis pose is the corrupt
      state only: 'older' and 'newer' render different screens and neither is
      driven here.`);
