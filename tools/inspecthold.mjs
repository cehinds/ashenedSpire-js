// tools/inspecthold.mjs — hold-to-inspect on the hand, observed: a read can
// happen, and a read can NEVER become a play.
//
// WHAT IT CHECKS, per shape (the disambiguation triangle, all three corners,
// plus the restore):
//   1. rest: every hand card is marked data-inspect="idle" (the gesture is
//      armed, readable by instrument and screenshot alike)
//   2. TAP corner: a quick tap on a targetable card still SELECTS it — the
//      pre-inspect behaviour, untouched
//   3. MID-HOLD: a stationary press reads data-inspect="pending" with no
//      expanded copy in the DOM — the attribute is the observation, so no
//      camera ever has to race a 400 ms window (the same-door note below)
//   4. INSPECT corner: past the dial the card expands — .card-inspect on
//      <body>, scaled visibly past the source card — and discard/energy are
//      UNCHANGED: the read cost nothing
//   5. restore: release removes the copy entirely, the card returns to idle,
//      state still unchanged, and the NEXT tap works (no swallowed tap —
//      Vira's F3 shape, checked here because this gesture swallows one click
//      by design and must swallow exactly that one)
//   6. abandon: movement past the shared 12 px boundary mid-pending hands the
//      press to the drag (ghost appears, inspect back to idle)
//   7. DRAG corner: a careful drag — 150 ms stationary, then onto an enemy —
//      still PLAYS the card (discard +1): the timer did not eat the game's
//      primary verb
//   8. reading is not gated on affordability: with energy forced to 0 (via
//      the window.__combat debug handle — the ONE state setup that does not
//      enter by the finger, named here rather than hidden) a hold on an
//      unaffordable card still expands
//   9-14. THE SAME GESTURE WITHOUT A POINTER (S7) — the keyboard cell and the
//      pad cell, each running the whole triangle: rest, mid-hold, open,
//      the read cost nothing, restore, and the TAP corner. See below.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THIS FILE GREW TWO MORE INPUTS, AND WHAT IT COULD NOT SEE BEFORE.
//
// Constantine, 2026-08-17: "if press to hold is active for certain things for
// mouse or game pad, it shoudl apply to everything including keyboard as well
// for those same buttons." (S7.)
//
// EVERY CHECK 1-8 ABOVE IS A POINTER CHECK, and all fourteen of them were green
// on a tree where a keyboard player could not read a card at all. MEASURED at
// dev b968e28, ?shot=combat 1200x730, the focus cursor on a hand card, Enter
// held 750 ms against a 400 ms dial: data-inspect never left `idle`, zero
// `.card-inspect` copies, AND THE CARD WAS SELECTED ON KEYDOWN. That absence is
// the finding this section exists for — an instrument that samples one input
// cannot tell you the gesture is a mouse feature.
//
// THE TWO DOORS, AND THEY ARE NOT THE SAME DEPTH — said plainly rather than
// both being called "real input":
//   keyboard  Input.dispatchKeyEvent — the same CDP door the touch checks use,
//             one layer above the page. Real keyDown/keyUp, and the hold is
//             driven with real `autoRepeat` keydowns because A HELD KEY IS NOT
//             ONE KEYDOWN: an OS sends the first and then a ~30 Hz stream, each
//             carrying `ev.repeat`. A harness that omits them measures a key
//             nobody holds. Arrows drive the real focus cursor.
//   gamepad   navigator.getGamepads, SHIMMED. There is NO CDP domain that
//             synthesizes a pad, so this is the deepest door a headless box
//             has: input.js's poller reads that function and nothing else, and
//             the shim is installed with Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument
//             so it is present before the app boots, exactly as a plugged-in
//             pad would be. WHAT IT THEREFORE CANNOT SEE: driver mapping,
//             analog thresholds, and the browser's own gamepad plumbing.
//             A green pad cell is a claim about this game's poller, never
//             about a physical controller.
// The shim is installed only for the pad cell and torn down after it: a pad
// visible during checks 1-8 would put the page in pad-mode and change the very
// hand those checks measure.
//
// WHY THE MODE AXIS RIDES ALONG UNCHANGED. Modes exist because `overlap`
// occludes a card's centre and a finger must aim at the exposed strip. A focus
// cursor does not aim — it names an element — so these cells have no aim point
// to get wrong. They still run in every cell rather than being argued out of
// three of them, because that argument is exactly the kind that turns out to be
// wrong about the ghost's size cap on the narrow shape.
//
// WHAT IS STILL POINTER-ONLY, AND IT IS NOT AN OVERSIGHT: the abandon corner
// (check 6) and the drag corner (check 7). Both are defined by MOVEMENT past
// the shared 12 px boundary, and neither a key nor a pad button has coordinates
// to move. The gesture door hands a key press the control's own centre, so slop
// can never fire. There is nothing to sample, not a cell nobody wrote.

//                                                  corpus is 2 shapes x 2 modes)

//                                                  open, released), per mode
// Exit: 0 all green · 1 a finding · 2 usage / no browser / NOTHING RAN
//
// THE MODE AXIS (C2). balance.ui.handLayout arranges the same hand two ways —
// 'paging' (the shipped strip) and 'overlap' (the whole hand in the strip's
// width) — and the gesture must survive both, so the corpus runs once per
// mode rather than once per tree. One axis, not a second file: the checks are
// the same 32, the mode enters through ?shotSettings (the app's own settings
// resolution, the same door a player's stored choice enters), and the ONE
// mode-aware line is where a press aims. In overlap a card's centre can lie
// under its right neighbour, so every aim point is the centre of the card's
// EXPOSED strip — a formula that degenerates to the plain centre wherever
// nothing overlaps, which keeps the paging runs aimed exactly where they
// always were. On a tree without the word (dev), the setting resolves to
// nothing and both mode runs see the shipped strip — the overlap arm is then
// measured by tools/handlayout.mjs going red, not by this corpus.
//
// OBSERVED RED (the instrument rule), same door as the real input — CDP touch
// on the shipped combat screen over ?shot=combat, exactly the entry
// tools/gesture-cancel.mjs already uses:
//   dev 86564e6 (pre-inspect)   exit 1, 18 FAIL (9 per shape): every
//                               inspect-specific line red by name
//                               (data-inspect never appears, nothing expands)
//                               — including "release: state unchanged",
//                               because on that tree A LONG STATIONARY PRESS
//                               PLAYS THE CARD ON RELEASE, which is precisely
//                               the press this gesture reclaims. The corners
//                               that were already true — tap selects,
//                               abandon-to-drag, drag plays — PASS there,
//                               which is exactly what they protect.
//   vega/hold-to-expand         exit 0, both shapes
//   dev b968e28 (pre-S7)        the keyboard and pad cells red at both shapes:
//                               data-inspect never leaves `idle` under a held
//                               Confirm, zero copies, AND `selected true` —
//                               the press was activating on keydown, so the
//                               hold could not exist and the card was played
//                               instead. Not ref-pinned: P3/P4/P5 below rebuild
//                               it from today's tree on demand.
// The run that produced those lines is in the branch report; re-run it with
// --root against any tree.
//
// ...AND THAT RED IS REF-PINNED, WHICH IS WHY --selftest EXISTS (Vira's doors
// audit, 2026-08-14: "SAME-DOOR when run; the known-bad tree is ref-pinned").
// It needs an 86564e6 checkout to still exist on someone's disk; under SOP 2's
// drift clause a red that cannot be re-run is `unknown (drifted)`, not
// coverage. So the corpus is BUILT now, not remembered: --selftest copies this
// tree, cuts ONE REAL LINE out of the gesture in the copy, and re-runs this
// whole tool at --root COPY — real serve, real boot, real CDP touch on the
// real combat screen. Nothing is handed to a function.
//
// THE FIVE PLANTS ARE THE FIVE CONTRACTS, not five convenient lines:
//   P1 swallow cut     holdconfirm.js stops arming the click-swallow at the
//                      lift of a completed read. Every visible thing still
//                      works — the card still expands, still restores — and
//                      the release's click now reaches the screen: A READ
//                      BECOMES A PLAY. That is the exact defect of the
//                      pre-inspect tree, rebuilt on demand instead of
//                      remembered. Expect "release: state unchanged" red.
//   P2 abandon cut     holdconfirm.js stops closing the pending inspect past
//                      the shared 12 px boundary — the ONE disambiguation
//                      boundary the tap, the drag and the read share. The
//                      gesture stops yielding to the drag. Expect "abandon"
//                      red while the tap and drag corners stay green.
//   P3 press unpublished   input.js activates on KEYDOWN again instead of
//                      publishing a press — one line, and it is byte for byte
//                      the pre-S7 tree. The keyboard hold dies; THE KEYBOARD
//                      TAP STAYS GREEN, which is what makes this the defect
//                      and not a crater. Expect "kbd: past the dial" red.
//   P4 release cut     input.js activates on release WHETHER OR NOT the
//                      gesture consumed it. The card still expands and still
//                      restores — and the release now also selects it: A READ
//                      BECOMES A PLAY, one input over from P1. Expect
//                      "kbd: the read did not select" red while the open
//                      check stays green.
//   P5 pad release cut input.js's poller stops reading the falling edge, which
//                      is the state a pad was in before this act: buttons rise
//                      and never fall. The hold OPENS and never ends. Expect
//                      "pad release: the copy is gone" red while the pad open
//                      check stays green.
//   C  clean control   the untouched copy must go GREEN, or a red below only
//                      proves that copying a tree breaks the app.
//
// Each plant refuses at exit 2 if its line does not match exactly once: an
// empty match means the OPPOSITE of clean (SOP 2's wrong-place-empty), and a
// corpus that silently stops matching is the eleven-instruments shape.
//
// BOUNDARY. Linux headless Chromium; synthesized touch is not a finger (no
// fling, no real contact patch). The mid-hold read (check 3) samples at
// ~150 ms of a 400 ms dial through Runtime.evaluate — a slow harness could
// sample late and read "open"; that fails loud, never silently green. The
// screenshot pass is evidence, not a check: it asserts nothing.
//
// REMOVAL: deleted the day the gesture leaves the hand, or a browser-level
// input harness supersedes CDP touch synthesis.

// THE ORDER IS BJORN'S AND IT IS NOT COSMETIC — 0fe6dfa..06b18f3, where he

// because SIGTERM starts an ASYNCHRONOUS shutdown and the dying Chromium
// re-creates the tree on its way out. And a `kill` reachable only on the happy
// path orphans a live browser whose profile then gets deleted underneath it,
// which is worse than leaking. So: module scope so the catch can reach it,
// SIGTERM, await `exit` with a 3 s ceiling, SIGKILL anything left, THEN remove.
//
// STILL A PATCH, with his number rather than a shrug: `child.kill()` signals the
// direct child only, so Chromium helpers can outlive it and re-create entries
// after rmSync. The fix is a process-group kill in ONE SHARED LAUNCHER — the
// lane, not a fourteenth private copy of it.
