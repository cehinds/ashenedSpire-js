// tools/handrenderers.mjs — THE GREEN-DEBT SENTINEL. How many places in this
// tree build the player's hand? The number is printed out loud, every run.
//
// Bjorn, 2026-08-15. My own sentence, adopted verbatim by Marina in the
// wave-four board (`2026-08-15-falk-wave-four-board.json`, scaryBlockerFirst):
//
//   > the renderer count gets said out loud at every train until it is one.
//
// WHY A TOOL AND NOT A MEMORY. The debt is GREEN debt: `coop.js` carries a
// second hand renderer, the suite is 83/0, axisfit exits 0, and nothing in this
// repo goes red about it. Green debt attracts no fixes — it is invisible to
// every instrument we own, so the only thing keeping it alive in the house is
// somebody remembering to mention it. *A gate you must remember to pass will be
// forgotten* (development.md, the carried-commit clause, on itself). A sentence
// in a packet is a memory; this is a check.
//
// AND IT IS DELIBERATELY NOT A BAN. The count being two is not illegal — Viki
// owns the collapse and it is in flight. What this makes impossible is SILENCE:
// the line below is written to be quoted verbatim in every gate report, so the
// number travels with the green instead of behind it. The day the count is one,
// this same line prints the discharge and nobody has to notice.
//
// THE PREDICATE, DERIVED, AND IT NAMES NO FILE. A hand renderer is a source
// file that CONSTRUCTS `.hand` markup — a class attribute whose tokens include
// exactly `hand`, or the same class set at runtime. Querying, filling or
// styling an existing `.hand` is not construction: after the collapse, coop.js
// may keep every `querySelector('.hand')` it has and the count still falls to
// one, which is the point of measuring construction. Two things this rules out
// on purpose, and both exist in this tree — see --selftest, plants 4 and 5:
//   · `class="hand-area"` — a different token, not a hand
//   · `"hand": "right"` in generated equipment content — a DATA KEY, never a
//     class. A grep for the word `hand` returns 200+ of these and would make
//     this sentinel a number nobody could act on.
//
// THE DECLARATION. `DECLARED` below is the count the house has agreed to carry,
// with the citation that tracks it. Observed == declared → exit 0, and the line
// still prints. Observed != declared → exit 1, because a tracked debt that moved
// without anyone editing the tracking is exactly the silence this file exists
// against. A DROP is good news and still exits 1: it costs one line to record,
// and the alternative is the discharge going unannounced.
//
// Usage:
//   node tools/handrenderers.mjs            count, print the line, verdict
//   node tools/handrenderers.mjs --json     the same, machine-readable
//   node tools/handrenderers.mjs --selftest the known-bad corpus (six plants)
// Exit: 0 observed == declared · 1 it moved · 2 the harness could not measure
//
// REMOVAL CONDITION (SOP 1's corollary): this file is DELETED the day the
// declared count is 1 and a second one cannot be born — i.e. when the hand is
// built in exactly one place and Viki's collapse has made the second unbuildable
// rather than merely absent. A sentinel over a debt that cannot recur is
// decoration, and I would rather delete it than let it print a comfortable 1
// forever.
