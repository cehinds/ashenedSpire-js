// tools/linkcheck.mjs — every named import in the tree resolves to a real
// export. Bjorn, 2026-08-08.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. `tools/release-shots.mjs` — the canonical release capture set,
// the instrument the release floor cited as green — exited 1 before a browser
// launched, because #88 renamed an export and left the consumer standing. It
// was not a failed check. IT WAS A FAILED LOAD, and the first thing that would
// have noticed was a person, at delivery time, tired.
//
// The suite already named the gap in its own BOUNDARY block:
//   "release-shots is the half that has watched a panel paint."
// It names that tool as covering what it cannot, and had never so much as
// LOADED it. Eleven instruments in this tree are started by a human typing.
// All eleven import `src/` statically — 1 to 8 static reads each, zero dynamic.
//
// THE CHEAP HALF IS THE WHOLE CLASS. "Run it on every change" does not require
// "a browser in the unit suite" and never did. `vm.SourceTextModule` + link()
// stops before evaluate(), and A MISSING NAMED EXPORT IS AN INSTANTIATION
// ERROR — raised during linking, before one line of any module body runs. So
// this reproduces #88's exact error text, launches no browser, binds no port,
// and touches no state. A cheap check that runs always beats an expensive one
// that runs never.
//
// LINKING IS NOT RUNNING, and this file prints that first on every run.
//
// WHAT AN AUTHOR WRITES: nothing. No tool registers itself, there is no
// manifest, and the denominator is a DIRECTORY WALK — a tool added tomorrow is
// linked on the next run with no edit to this file. That is the only reason
// this is worth more than the grep it replaces. What IS authored is the plants
// in --selftest, and those are the check's own corpus, never its denominator.
// NO COUNT OF THEM IS TYPED HERE — the RESULT line carries it, and a number
// beside a list is the second copy this house exists to catch.
//
// I WROTE A REGEX FOR DYNAMIC import() TARGETS AND DELETED IT. On its first run
// it reported a file BROKEN because of a SENTENCE IN THAT FILE describing the
// regex. It was also unnecessary: the directory walk links every in-tree module
// whether or not anything imports it. The gap it would have closed — a dynamic
// target that has been deleted — is named in the boundary below instead of
// bought with a matcher that reads comments. (`tools/bundle.test.mjs` writes
// `from 'lodash'` INTO A TEMPLATE STRING as a fixture; a parser does not see it
// and a regex does. That is the whole argument.)
//
//   usage: node tools/linkcheck.mjs [--raw] [--selftest]
//     --selftest  plant known breakages in a COPY of the tree and require each
//                 to be caught. Never touches the working tree. Three verdicts
//                 per plant — CAUGHT, MISSED, UNPLANTABLE — because a plant that
//                 never applied measured nothing and must not be read as either.
//   exit 0 = every module graph links   1 = a broken import
//        2 = COULD NOT ANSWER — the flag re-exec failed, or the corpus could not
//            be scored (UNTESTABLE: the tree is already broken · UNPLANTABLE: a
//            plant did not apply). Unknown blocks exactly as red does.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------- selftest
// FIVE PLANTS, EACH THE SHAPE OF A REAL FAILURE THIS TREE HAS HAD OR COULD.
// They are applied to a COPY, so --selftest never edits the working tree and a
// crash mid-run cannot leave it dirty.
//
// UNPLANTABLE IS NEVER MISSED — the numerator's half of the guard. Sten found
// it: `UNTESTABLE` below asks whether a plant CAN mean anything (the
// denominator — a tree already broken cannot score a corpus), and NOTHING here
// asked whether the plant APPLIED. Every edit below is a String.replace, which
// returns the original string when its pattern stops matching AND REPORTS
// NOTHING. He imported one more real name into release-shots.mjs — correct
// code, tree links clean — and plant 1's pattern quietly matched nothing, so
// this tool printed `MISSED`: a well-formed, confident, FALSE claim about
// itself, pointing a reader at a check that was never broken.
//
// So a plant now ASSERTS THAT IT LANDED. Every edit goes through `edit`,
// `prepend` or `move` below, each of which throws `Unplantable` when its target
// is gone or its pattern matched nothing. Three verdicts, not two:
//
//   CAUGHT       the plant applied and the check went red for the right reason
//   MISSED       the plant applied and the check did NOT catch it — a defect
//                in this tool, and the only verdict that indicts the check
//   UNPLANTABLE  the plant never applied, so NOTHING WAS MEASURED. Not a miss,
//                not a catch. It blocks like UNTESTABLE does, and for the same
//                reason: unknown blocks exactly as red does.
//
// The error runs in the SAFE direction. A corpus that has drifted off the tree
// costs an hour of somebody re-anchoring a pattern; it never ships a defect,
// because UNPLANTABLE cannot be read as clearance. `MISSED` on a plant that was
// never planted is the opposite: it spends that hour on the wrong file.
