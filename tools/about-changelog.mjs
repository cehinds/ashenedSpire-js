// The prose has ONE home — CHANGELOG.md — and TWO readers: GitHub, which renders
// Markdown, and Settings → About, which escapes every character as plain text
// (`about.js`, `esc(entry.detail)`). Copying prose verbatim therefore shipped the
// SYNTAX to the player: #290's `**Settings → Advanced → Reward collection**` with
// its asterisks, and #186's backticks before it, in every artifact.
//
// The projection FLATTENS the inline subset the file actually uses, so the author
// keeps writing Markdown and each reader is handed what it can read — Law 0 c.1,
// the machinery derives. It REFUSES what it cannot flatten without losing the
// information (a link loses its href, an image loses everything), so a future
// author is told by name instead of shipping a mangled receipt — Law 0 c.5: a
// missing field that fails loud is cheap; a plausible wrong one is invisible.
//
// BOUNDARY: a flattener, not a Markdown parser. It knows emphasis and code spans;
// it does not know tables, block constructs or nested emphasis and claims nothing
// about them. AND IT CLAIMS NOTHING ABSOLUTE ABOUT THE ONES IT DOES KNOW: four
// heads running, each closed the form it was blocked on and left the CLAIM
// absolute, and the claim went false again on the next spelling — the fourth time
// on a form the third fix had just created. REFUSAL_SCOPE now names a SUBSET and
// says forms outside it reach the player. That sentence is true after the next
// finding instead of false after each one, and it is the fix. REMOVAL: deleted the day Settings → About renders Markdown itself,
// at which point this is a second copy of that renderer's job.
//
// THE REFUSAL DOES NOT COVER EVERY FORM, AND THIS COMMENT SAID IT DID.
//
// It read "THE REFUSAL COVERS EVERY LINK FORM THIS FILE CAN CARRY" and that was
// FALSE when written. Sunna measured four forms walking past it on 2026-08-22, each
// at `--write` exit 0 and each reaching the projection: `[details]()`, an HTML
// comment, `<?php ?>`, and `[SS]` against a `[ß]: url` definition. She checked the
// ink: `esc()` renders them as visible text, so THE HTML COMMENT GITHUB HIDES IS
// SHOWN TO THE PLAYER IN FULL. And the sharpest of it — `[x]()` was never a sixth
// spelling, it was a HOLE IN THE FIRST ONE: the inline pattern required a non-empty
// destination, so even "recognises `[text](url)`" was not quite true.
//
// A false completeness sentence is worse than a missing one. A reader who trusts it
// stops looking; a missing boundary at least leaves them uninformed rather than
// confidently wrong. THE LIST BELOW IS THE CLAIM NOW, and it is printed at runtime
// (REFUSAL_SCOPE) rather than living only here, because a boundary in a `//` comment
// is invisible to everyone reading the tool's green — Law 0 clause 4, and Vira's
// "the door named is the extent of the green".
//
// The shortcut form cannot be seen in one line of prose — `[docs]` is a link only
// if a definition for it exists — so `parseChangelog` collects the file's defined
// labels and hands them down. With no definitions in the file the check is inert,
// which is why it cannot fire on ordinary bracketed prose.
//
// NOT A WHITELIST, deliberately, and this is measured rather than preferred:
// CHANGELOG.md legitimately carries non-ASCII on 14 lines — em-dashes and arrows.
// A plain-text whitelist reds the corpus on day one, and one tuned until it stops
// is a blacklist with a better name.

// THE BRACKETED FORMS ARE COUNTED, NOT PATTERN-MATCHED, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT.
//
// CommonMark allows brackets inside LINK TEXT "if they appear as a matched pair of
// brackets", to ANY depth: `[the [advanced] guide](/guide)` is a valid link and
// GitHub renders it. `\[[^\]]+\]\([^)]*\)` stops at the INNER `]` and let it
// through — measured 2026-08-22 by Codex and by Bjorn at the real door, `--write`
// exit 0, the syntax in `changelog.generated.js` and on the glass.
//
// That was the THIRD hole in one pattern (`[x]()` was the second), and a third hole
// in one line is a shape, not a bug: WIDENING THE CHARACTER CLASS BUYS ONE LEVEL OF
// NESTING AND RE-OPENS ON TWO. So the depth is counted. Backslash-escaped brackets
// and parens are skipped, per CommonMark; the destination's own parens nest too
// (`[a](/x(y))`).
//
// BOUNDARY, and it is a real one: this is a SCANNER, NOT A PARSER. What it does
// about that is MASK CODE SPANS BEFORE EVERY REFUSAL SCAN, because "it does not
// know code spans" had TWO directions and only one of them was printed.
//
// The printed one was the over-fire: `` `arr[0](x)` `` refused though GitHub renders
// it as code. Harmless — the author is told, and rewrites.
//
// THE ONE THAT WAS NOT PRINTED IS THE ONE THAT MATTERED. The same blindness makes
// a `]` inside a code span close a link label EARLY, so ``[the `]` guide](/guide)``
// — a valid CommonMark link — was not refused, and the flattener then removed the
// backticks and shipped `See [the ] guide](/guide)`. NOT A LEAK, A CORRUPTION: every
// other form this PR found shipped the author's own words; this one rewrote the
// sentence into words nobody wrote. Measured by Sten 2026-08-22 at the file door,
// `--write` exit 0. A declared limit that names only the safe direction is worse
// than an undeclared one: it tells the reader which way not to look.
//
// So one mask closes both directions at once, and it DELIBERATELY reads the same
// span scanner the flattener uses — 1b's lesson, one home: two transforms meant to
// agree and written twice will disagree. The mask is length-preserving, so every
// index the refusal scanners compute still points at the real character.
