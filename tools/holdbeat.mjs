// tools/holdbeat.mjs — DID THE BEAT ACTUALLY MAKE A SOUND? (Vega, 2026-08-08.)
//
// THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR. A press-and-hold whose only feedback is a fill is
// a gesture you cannot tell is working once your hand is on top of the fill.
// Measured at 390x844: the event screen's bar is 378x44 mid-screen, and END
// TURN IS 190.2x50.4 AT y=784.6 OF AN 844 px VIEWPORT — a control about the
// size of a contact patch, in the bottom 60 px, approached from below. The
// player presses, sees nothing, presses again, and the thing the hold was
// protecting them from fires twice.
//
// WHY THE INSTRUMENT IS BUILT THE WAY IT IS, and this is the whole point of the
// file. Audio is the easiest claim in this repo to fake. `sfx.recent` records
// every id a call site fired, and it is GREEN WHETHER OR NOT ANY SOUND CAME OUT
// — it is a list of intentions. This tool therefore measures SAMPLES: an
// AnalyserNode is spliced in front of `ctx.destination` before the page's
// scripts run, and the peak amplitude of the actually-rendered audio is polled
// every 8 ms. A tick that is scheduled into a suspended context reads 0.000
// here and reads "fired" in `sfx.recent`, and THAT EXACT DIVERGENCE IS THE BUG
// THIS SESSION FOUND, so `--mutate` reproduces it deliberately.
//
// OBSERVED RED — `--mutate` neuters `ctx.resume` and suspends the AudioContext
// after unlocking it, before every measured hold. Every DOM transition still
// happens, every call site still fires, `sfx.recent` still fills, and NOT ONE
// SAMPLE IS PRODUCED. The sample checks must go red WHILE THE CALL-LEVEL COUNT
// STAYS GREEN, and the run prints both numbers side by side — a check that
// cannot tell those two apart is the check that would have shipped this bug.
// (development.md, the instrument rule.)
//
// WHAT IT CHECKS
//   0. A SILENT BASELINE. Before touching anything: 400 ms of nothing must
//      measure ~0. If music or a bed is leaking into the tap, every number
//      below is about the wrong signal and the run says so instead of
//      crediting the leak to the beat.
//   1. A COMPLETED HOLD IS AUDIBLE — peak well over the floor, and the ONSETS
//      are counted and must equal len(balance.ui.holdBeat.at) + 1.
//   2. THE ABORT IS QUIETER THAN THE COMMIT, and fires no arrival. Releasing
//      early is the feature; a commit sound on an abort would be the cue lying
//      about system state.
//   3. THE BEAT IS DERIVED, NOT WIRED. An element that starts publishing
//      `data-hold` at runtime — one nothing in the tree has ever seen — gets a
//      beat, and one carrying `data-hold-action` composes its own id. Law 0's
//      falsifier for this control: a new action that holds arrives with sound
//      and ZERO code edits.
//   4. BOTH EDGES OF THE DIAL. `off` wires no hold, so it must make no beat at
//      all; `long` must still land its arrival.
//   5. THE FIRST HOLD OF A FRESH PAGE, REPORTED not asserted. See below.
//   6. HAPTICS, REPORTED not asserted. See below.
//   7. THE COST AT HOLD #200. One whole confirmation, measured against one
//      `cardPlay`, on the shared analytic meter (tools/sfx-loudness.mjs — the
//      same instrument, imported, not a second copy).
//
// TWO THINGS THIS TOOL REPORTS AND REFUSES TO ASSERT, each for its own reason:
//
//   THE FIRST HOLD. Chromium grants user activation for a TOUCH at the lift,
//   not at the press: measured here, `pointerdown` and `touchstart` see
//   `userActivation.isActive === false` and `pointerup`/`touchend` see true,
//   while a MOUSE press activates immediately. A press-and-hold fires at full
//   fill with the finger still down, so the page's very first hold runs
//   entirely inside a suspended context and NOTHING CAN MAKE IT SOUND. That is
//   a browser rule, not a defect of ours, and asserting it would be a red
//   nobody can ever fix — the shape people learn to step over. It is printed
//   with its number every run.
//
//   HAPTICS. `navigator.vibrate` exists in headless Chromium on a Linux box
//   with no vibration motor AND RETURNS TRUE. There is no callback, no event
//   and no query: the API reports that a pattern was ACCEPTED, never that a
//   device buzzed. So no check here can distinguish a phone that vibrated from
//   one that did not, feature detection is a lie on every desktop, and iOS
//   Safari has no `navigator.vibrate` at all. The run prints what it found;
//   the decision not to ship haptics is in the report, not in an exit code.
//
// Usage
//   node tools/holdbeat.mjs                  source tree via tools/serve.mjs
//   node tools/holdbeat.mjs --dist           dist/AshenSpire.html (file://; http if pack-shaped — browser.mjs buildPageUrl)
//   node tools/holdbeat.mjs --mutate         must catch a suspended context
//   CHROME=/path/to/chrome node tools/holdbeat.mjs
//
// Exit codes
//   0  every check held     1  a real failure
//   2  usage / no browser / nothing measured / --mutate not caught
//
// BOUNDARY, and it is not small: headless Chromium on one Linux machine, ONE
// shape (390x844), CDP-synthesised touch, and NO EARS ANYWHERE IN IT. It proves
// samples were rendered with the right count and the right relative levels. It
// does not know whether the phrase is pleasant, whether three ticks is two too
// many at hold #200, or what any of it sounds like through a phone speaker.
// Nobody has listened to this. Check 7 is a PROXY for fatigue, not a measure of
// it. And it says nothing about the visible channel, which is the one a muted
// player has and the one that is under the thumb on End Turn.
//
// REMOVAL CONDITION (SOP 1's corollary): deleted the day no control in the game
// holds — with no hold there is no beat and this tool has no subject.

  // of 1.4 never arrives, a NaN compares false against every progress reading,
  // a descending list fires the late tick once and then never again, and a
  // duplicate fires two ticks in one frame that a player hears as one. In all
  // four the screen is unchanged and the sound is simply absent — which is the
  // exact state the beat exists to distinguish from a tap that missed. That is
  // the same shape Vira found on holdConfirm one row over, so it gets the same
