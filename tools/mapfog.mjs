// tools/mapfog.mjs — does the fog cover the right things, and does the screen
// draw what the ladder says it drew?
//
// TWO HALVES, and neither ships without the other.
//
//   --selftest   THE LADDER, headless, against real generated graphs and against
//                a bench of DELIBERATELY BROKEN light rules. Every property here
//                has been watched to fail: each mutant below is a fog somebody
//                could plausibly have written, and the table prints which
//                property caught it. A property no mutant kills is decoration
//                and is reported as such — `unknown`, never green.
//   (default)    THE RENDERED PAGE, over CDP, walking an act step by step and
//                comparing the SET of nodes the DOM actually holds against the
//                set `model/mapknowledge.js` says it should. Two counts agreeing
//                is not two sets agreeing, so this compares ids.
//
// WHY BOTH. The ladder is pure and the screen is what a player meets, and the
// gap between them is where this class of bug lives: a correct ladder whose
// rungs the stylesheet paints identically is a fog that covers nothing, and
// every headless check in the tree stays green through it.
//
// THE PROPERTY THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN, and it is the one worth reading first:
//
//   FOG ONLY EVER LOWERS A NODE TO `hidden`. For every node, in every position,
//   the fog rung is either `hidden` or EXACTLY the rung it has in `path` mode.
//
// That is Viki's two-axes finding made executable. `revealUnknown` answers "what
// kind of place is that"; fog answers "is it drawn at all". If fog is ever seen
// changing a node from `known` to `placed`, the two axes have been welded into
// one lever and the relic has become a special case again — which is the defect
// this whole shape exists to prevent, caught rather than remembered.
//
// Usage
//   node tools/mapfog.mjs --selftest            the ladder + the mutant bench
//   node tools/mapfog.mjs                       the rendered walk, source tree
//   node tools/mapfog.mjs --dist                against dist/AshenSpire.html

//   node tools/mapfog.mjs --seeds A,B --steps 1,3,5,7,9
//   node tools/mapfog.mjs --mutate              falsify the page's own census
//   CHROME=/path/to/chrome node tools/mapfog.mjs
//
// Exit codes
//   0  every property holds, every mutant was caught, and the page's drawn set
//      equals the ladder's at every cell swept
//   1  a finding
//   2  usage / no browser / a screen that would not mount / NOTHING SWEPT —
//      which is unknown, and unknown is never a pass
//
// BOUNDARY, and it is not small. The rendered half is headless Chromium on one
// Linux machine, the shapes and seeds named on the command line, one act each.
// It proves WHICH NODES ARE IN THE DOM. It does not prove the fog reads as fog
// (Sunna), that the parchment is anything but a placeholder (Freja), or that a
// player enjoys climbing blind. And it never renders the `<image>` plate: those
// three files do not exist yet, so every shot below is of the placeholder wash.
