// tools/uistrings.mjs — THE COPY RATCHET. How many sentences does the
// interface still keep in its code rather than in its table, and where?
//
// WHY. The 2026-09-11 content review counted the interface's copy and found it
// scattered: literals in 64 files under src/ui, hundreds of them distinct, with
// the same thing said two ways in two screens ("storage is full" beside
// "Storage full") and no way to reword the game without a code change. The
// answer is content/source/uiStrings.csv (the table) plus src/ui/strings.js
// (the lookup). The answer is not a weekend: migrating every screen at once is
// one enormous diff over surfaces only a browser can check.
//
// So this is the instrument that makes the migration a ONE-WAY street. It
// counts the copy sites left in code, per file, against tools/uistrings-
// baseline.json, and --check fails in BOTH directions:
//   · a file that GREW invented copy in code instead of asking the table — the
//     regression this exists to stop;
//   · a file that SHRANK and did not record it — an overstated baseline hides
//     the next regression inside its slack (tools/plantsites.mjs's rule, and
//     the reason that tool is the shape this one copies).
//
// WHAT COUNTS AS A COPY SITE, stated so a reader can argue with it rather than
// guess: a string literal that a human will READ, in one of the positions this
// codebase puts read-able text:
//   · a value for one of the copy keys (label:, title:, eyebrow:, note:, …)
//   · an assignment to .textContent / .innerText
//   · setAttribute('aria-label' | 'title' | 'placeholder', '…')
//   · an 'aria-label': '…' pair inside an attrs object
// and that LOOKS like prose rather than machinery: it has a letter, is longer
// than two characters, and is not a bare identifier (`small`), a selector
// (`.card`), a URL, a camelCase token (`rewardCollect`), or a dotted
// uiStrings id (`shop.review.buy.card` — a file that asks the table by id has
// already done the migration this counts). Template literals
// are deliberately NOT counted: an interpolated string is a sentence and an
// expression at once, and a count that includes them would move whenever the
// expression moved. They are copy too — the baseline's `note` says so rather
// than letting the number imply the work is smaller than it is.
//
//   node tools/uistrings.mjs                 the census, worst files first
//   node tools/uistrings.mjs --check         verify against the baseline; exit 1 on ANY difference
//   node tools/uistrings.mjs --write-baseline rewrite the baseline from the tree
//   node tools/uistrings.mjs --selftest      plant a new literal and a removed one; both must be CAUGHT
//
// BOUNDARY, and one limit worth naming: this reads the file as TEXT, comments
// included, so a comment that quotes a copy position (`title: "Draw pile"`)
// counts as one. Rare, and stripping comments correctly is its own parser; a
// comment that trips it should be reworded rather than the count fudged.
//
// A green here does NOT mean the migrated screens read well, that
// the table's ids are reachable, or that a string in the table is the one a
// screen shows. It counts literals in positions. The table's own rules —
// unknown id, missing form, unresolved token, extends cycles — are
// tests/ui-strings.test.mjs, and what a screen actually paints is the browser
// gates.
//
// REMOVAL: deleted the day the census is zero and no position can carry a
// literal again — not the day the number merely looks small.
