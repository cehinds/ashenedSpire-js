# Vira measured the palette distances in outfits.csv. I accepted them. Bjorn
# pointed out that a capture proves you looked, not what you looked for — and
# the same trap has a deeper floor here:
#
#   The CSV hex is the INPUT. What reaches the eye is that colour through a warm
#   key light, a cool rim, a hero rim at 2.6, and the Standard view transform.
#   Measuring the source is measuring the adjacent thing.
#
# So this reads the rendered pixels. It also measures the comparison that
# actually matters, which is not the one either of us ran: WITHIN a class the
# geometry is identical (one builder, four repaints), so palette is the only
# differentiator. BETWEEN classes the silhouettes differ completely — plate and
# helm, robe and wide hat, hood and halo — so palette carries almost nothing.

# ── TWO DEFECTS FOUND 2026-07-27, both with re-runnable evidence ──────────────
#
# Commit 40c5b21 stopped a repaint with "the metric measures hue where hue is
# invalid" and did not build the instrument that would prove it. It is now built:
# tools/palette-probe.html + tools/palette-check.sh, 20 declared checks, no
# Blender required (it decodes the shipped .webp with the same decoder the game
# uses). Run `bash tools/palette-check.sh`. It found the named defect and one
# more nobody had named:
#
#   1. HUE AT INVALID CHROMA — real, and fixed below. dhue() had no chroma guard,
#      so it reported an angle between two neutrals as if it meant something. The
#      shipped manifest records dHueDeg=133.05 for starseer default|eclipse, whose
#      chromas are 0.018 and 0.008 — both under Vira's 0.03 guard. dhue() now
#      REFUSES rather than returning a number that cannot be interpreted.
#
#   2. THE COLOUR PIPELINE — NOT fixed here, deliberately. See the banner at the
#      top of this file. Evidence, all observed on 2026-07-27 by
#      `bash tools/palette-check.sh` and quoted from that run, not from memory:
#
#        - the double-encode model reproduces all three of the manifest's
#          withinClassMin to 0.04%, 0.01% and 0.04% (herald, reaver, starseer)
#          and names the SAME tightest pair in all three classes (D1b);
#        - measuring the same shipped .webp straight, in browser sRGB, misses by
#          37.9% / 34.3% / 29.7% and names a DIFFERENT tightest pair for herald
#          (D1a);
#        - one figure, starseer/starlit, is pushed across the chroma guard by the
#          encode alone (D2b) — so the commit's "3 of 12 below guard" is a fact
#          about this pipeline, not about the art, which gives 2 of 12;
#        - the hue angle of a single figure moves up to 15.3deg between the two
#          pipelines (D4c).
#
#      MAGNITUDE, CORRECTED 2026-07-27 — I first wrote "~27% low chroma
#      EVERYWHERE". The number was fine; the word was the defect. Recomputed by
#      the probe from its own twelve figures (no longer a literal I typed once):
#      chroma is low by a MEDIAN of 27.6%, RANGE 18.9% (starseer/default) to
#      51.8% (starseer/starlit). So "~27%" describes the median honestly and
#      "everywhere" hides a 2.7x spread — and that spread is precisely the
#      mechanism that pushes starseer/starlit across the chroma guard on the
#      encode alone. The one word I chose for tidiness concealed the one fact
#      that mattered most. I also mis-stated this correction on the first pass,
#      quoting 28.0% / 18.8% from the run's 4-decimal printout instead of the
#      full-precision values; these figures come from the probe's own arithmetic.
#
#      NOT FIXED because there is no Blender in the environment that found this,
#      so the corrected pipeline could not be run end to end. A blind edit to the
#      one line that produced every number in the manifest is exactly the "third
#      instrument on a hunch" 40c5b21 was right to refuse. The gate above fails
#      until it is fixed and the assets re-measured, so it cannot be forgotten.
#
# ── THE ONE LINE I DID NOT TOUCH, AND WHAT WOULD MAKE TOUCHING IT SAFE ────────
#
# The line: the three `acc[i] += to_srgb(...)` calls in body_lab(). The fix is
# almost certainly to delete the to_srgb() wrapper and accumulate the linear
# values bpy hands back — but "almost certainly" is not a licence to edit the
# line that produced every number in the shipped manifest.
#
# Cited by FUNCTION NAME, never by line number, on purpose: the refs that were
# correct at 40c5b21 (`to_srgb` at :31-32, the acc lines at :71-73, `dhue` at
# :102-105) were all invalidated by this very commit's own edits to the file
# above them. A line ref is a second copy of a fact with nothing checking the two
# agree. Function names do not drift.
#
# FOUR THINGS MUST BE TRUE BEFORE ANYONE EDITS IT. All four, not a majority:
#
#   1. A BLENDER THAT CAN RUN THIS. The whole diagnosis rests on what bpy returns
#      from `img.pixels` for a .webp — the comment above the loop asserts LINEAR
#      and the reproduction says otherwise. That is a claim about Blender, and it
#      is settled by running Blender, not by reading. Print one known pixel of a
#      known asset and compare it to the browser's decode of the same pixel.
#      Until then the DIRECTION of the fix is inferred, only the EFFECT is
#      measured. Both edges: check a near-black pixel (where the linear segment
#      c <= 0.0031308 applies) and a bright one, because the two branches of
#      to_srgb() fail differently and a mid-grey test passes either way.
#
#   2. A REGENERATE, NOT A RE-READ. Fixing this changes every number in
#      asset-data/equipment/manifest.json. The manifest must be rewritten by the same
#      run that renders the images (measure() is called from
#      tools/equipment-blender.py for exactly this reason). A fixed body_lab()
#      beside a stale manifest is strictly worse than today: today the numbers
#      are wrong and the file says so.
#
#   3. THE GATE MUST FLIP FOR THE RIGHT REASON. After the fix,
#      `bash tools/palette-check.sh` must fail at D1b — the double-encode model
#      must STOP reproducing the manifest. If D1b still passes, the fix did not
#      reach the numbers that ship. Delete D1a/D1b/D2b then; do not retune them.
#
#   4. TEST 34 MUST BE RE-READ, NOT RE-RUN. It is the only consumer of these
#      numbers. Probe D12 measured that every class clears its 0.005 floor in
#      BOTH pipelines and that the audit's numbers are the LOWER pair (1.34x), so
#      the defect makes test 34 fire EARLY, not late. That is why this is not a
#      shipping emergency — and also why nobody may treat a green test 34 as
#      evidence the colour pipeline is fine. Its margin is thinner than it looks.
#
# Whoever does this owns all four. It is not mine: I cannot run Blender and I
# will not claim a pipeline works because I meant it to.
#
# ── REMOVAL CONDITION (SOP 1's corollary) ─────────────────────────────────────
#
# This file is deleted, without a table, when ANY of these holds:
#
#   1. Nothing consumes its output. Today exactly one thing does — test 34, via
#      asset-data/equipment/manifest.json. If test 34 stops reading withinClassMin,
#      this tool measures something nobody asks about and it goes.
#   2. A masked, per-pixel instrument replaces it. This file's own method block
#      says the whole-figure mean is the wrong instrument, and probe D7b measured
#      that it disagrees with a per-pixel measure of the same images about which
#      pair is closest in 2 of 3 classes. When the better instrument exists, this
#      one is not kept for comparison — a superseded metric still in the tree is
#      a second answer to one question.
#   3. `--selfcheck` stops being able to fail. Invert any one `ok()` predicate; if
#      the exit status stays 0, the corpus is decoration.
#   4. Constantine's one word.
#
# The double-gamma defect is deliberately NOT a removal condition. Fixing it
# makes this file correct, not unnecessary.
