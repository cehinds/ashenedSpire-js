#!/usr/bin/env node
// tools/shotguard-probe.mjs — prove, in a real browser, that a ?shot= boot cannot
// write to the player's durable save, and that a normal boot still can.
//
// WHY A BROWSER AND NOT A UNIT TEST
// --------------------------------
// The defect was a URL reaching localStorage: `?shot=map` wrote
// settings.seenTutorial into sote_meta_v1 and then newRun({slot:1}) →
// startClimb() → persist() → saveRun(run, rng, 1) overwrote sote_run_v1. Nothing
// about that is reachable from Node — it needs `location.search`, a real
// `window.localStorage`, and the module graph actually booting. A unit test here
// would assert my own mock, which is the shape of evidence this branch exists to
// delete.
//
// HOW IT MEASURES
// --------------
// CDP `Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument` installs a recorder BEFORE any page
// script runs, wrapping localStorage.setItem/removeItem and logging every key.
// So we observe writes directly, rather than comparing before/after values — a
// write of identical bytes would pass a value comparison and is still a write.
//
// The discriminator is `sote_probe`: pickStorage() sets and removes it to test
// that localStorage is usable. Its presence in the log means localStorage was
// chosen; its absence means the memory stub was.
//
//   node tools/shotguard-probe.mjs                     both edges

//   node tools/shotguard-probe.mjs --mutate            same, inverted → must exit 0
//   node tools/shotguard-probe.mjs --selftest-unavailable
//                                                      prove exit 2 is reachable
//   --browser <path>            use this binary (how the unavailable cases are driven)
//   --acquire-timeout-ms <n>    ceiling on a cold start, default 60000
//
// EXIT CODES — three states, and the distinction is load-bearing:
//   0  the gate holds (or --mutate correctly saw it fail)
//   1  a check RAN and the gate did not hold
//   2  the instrument was unavailable → `unknown`, which blocks, but says nothing
//      about the gate. Never conflate 1 and 2; I did, and it failed this repo's
//      first CI run. See the block above unavailable().
//
// Zero dependencies: Node 22's global WebSocket speaks CDP directly.
//
// REMOVAL CONDITION (SOP 1's corollary): delete this file the day the ?shot=
// hook is removed from src/main.js, or the day the shot states stop booting a run
// at all (e.g. they are replaced by static fixtures) — with no run to persist
// there is nothing for this to guard. It is NOT removed merely because it has
// passed for a long time; a guard that has never failed is exactly what it was
// written to replace, which is why every verdict it can reach is triggerable:
//
//   --defeat-gate            rewrites src/main.js on the wire with the gate line
//                            deleted → a check runs and fails → exit 1
//   --mutate                 the same defeat, expectation inverted → exit 0
//   --selftest-unavailable   triggers all three unavailability branches → each 2
//
// Between them every exit code this tool produces is reachable on demand. A tool
// whose failure modes only ever appear by accident on someone else's machine is
// not evidence — and that is not hypothetical: run 1 of this repo's CI is where I
// learned it.

// through a `throw` to exit 1 — so a cold GitHub runner (server up 20:44:44.27,

// seconds later. Same colour, opposite meaning — the silence-guard confusion my
// own workflow comment warns about, committed here.

// Every acquisition failure now routes through unavailable(), which cannot reach
// exit 1. A check must have RUN to make the run red.

// Acquire the CDP endpoint. Replaces a blind 60 x 250ms poll of a hard-coded port,
// which is what timed out at 15.06s on this repo's first CI run.
//
// Three signals instead of one, so the wait ends for the RIGHT reason:
//   1. DevToolsActivePort in the profile dir — Chrome writes it after the port is
//      listening, so its appearance is the authoritative ready signal. Line 1 is
//      the port, line 2 the browser ws path.
//   2. "DevTools listening on ws://…" on stderr — the same fact by another route;
//      kept because it survives a profile dir we cannot read.
//   3. The child exiting — if the browser is DEAD, waiting out the budget tells us
//      nothing we do not already know. Bail immediately.
//
// The budget went 15s → 60s, but note what the budget is now FOR: with a real
// ready signal it is only the ceiling on a genuinely slow cold start, not the
// thing we are relying on to detect readiness. Raising a timeout until it stops
// firing would be the author grading his own guard — which is why
// --selftest-unavailable exists and triggers this path on purpose.
