// tools/mobileart-policy.mjs — the one home for what "mobile art" means.
//
// The mobile edition is the same game with smaller art. Which files shrink, by
// how much, and how the result is judged are stated HERE and nowhere else, so
// the generator (tools/mobile-art.mjs), the bundler (tools/bundle.mjs) and the
// gate (tools/mobile-art.mjs --check, tools/verify-shipped.mjs) cannot disagree
// about the shape of the tree they share. This module is pure: no main, no
// writes, Node core only, so the bundler can import it without running a tool.
//
// It is listed in BUILD_IDENTITY_FILES (tools/buildversion.mjs): a change here
// changes what the mobile bundle carries, so it moves build identity.

 * Non-webp art (svg) is copied verbatim. Authoring-only trees are excluded by
 * the same runtimeAsset() rule the full build uses.

 * at quality 35 / alpha 40 — about 48% of the half-size twin tree, measured on
