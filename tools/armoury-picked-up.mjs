// tools/armoury-picked-up.mjs — the Armoury tells the truth about what you are
// carrying, and every item is a card you press.
//
// Constantine, 2026-08-21, three asks in one message and one correction after:
//   1. "it should only show armory you actually picked up mid run"
//   2. "each item should be folded panes that can expand"
//   3. "clicking on the armory item pane should auto expand it with a button to
//      equip (un equip in red if it's already equipped)"
//   correction: "the sub button under the folded weapon army item pane should
//      NOT exist. it should be part of the card and is revealed pressing the
//      card instead"
//
// THREE PROPERTIES, ONE PER ASK, AND A3 CARRIES THE CORRECTION AS A NEGATIVE.
//
//   A1  THE SHELF IS THE RUN'S, NOT THE PROFILE'S. Every piece the picker
//       offers is one this RUN carries (or one tagged basic — his own earlier
//       ask, A7, and the one exception this property allows by name). Measured
//       at the MODEL door, `ownership()` in src/model/loadout.js, because that
//       is the single predicate `eligible()` in the screen calls; a page count
//       is carried beside it as the surface witness.
//   A2  EVERY ITEM ARRIVES FOLDED. Each candidate is a face with
//       aria-expanded="false" and nothing revealed under it at open.
//   A3  THE CARD IS THE CONTROL. Pressing a face opens exactly that face,
//       reveals one equip control, and that control says Unequip — carrying the
//       danger class, which is what "in red" is in this stylesheet — when the
//       piece is the one already in the set. AND THE NEGATIVE, which is his
//       correction stated as a check: no pressable control exists in the
//       candidate list that is not a face, inside the revealed panel, OR THE
//       ONE GRIP A6 RULES ON. A sub button relabelled is still a sub button,
//       and this is what catches it.
//
//       THE EXCEPTION IS HIM OVERRIDING HIMSELF AND IT IS NOT SMOOTHED HERE.
//       On 2026-08-21 he corrected item 3 to *"the sub button ... should NOT
//       exist"*; on the same day he ruled TWO ELEMENTS, which puts a control
//       back outside the card. Both sentences are his, the second is later, and
//       the check follows the later one — but only for a control that is
//       exactly `.ep-hold`, exactly one per face, immediately after its own
//       face. Anything else outside a card is still A3.stray.
//
//   A6  TWO ELEMENTS, ONE GESTURE EACH (his ruling, 2026-08-21). The grip holds
//       the hold and nothing else: a real pointer press, held past the player's
//       own dial, equips — and an EARLY RELEASE does nothing at all, neither
//       equipping (rule 1) nor leaking a click into the card's unfold path.
//       The card keeps its click, the in-card button keeps its click, and
//       NEITHER of the other two is armed. Driven with REAL CDP INPUT — mouse
//       and touch — not DOM `.click()`, because a hold is a pointer press by
//       nature and a wired handler is not a finger.
//
// DOOR. The source tree, served by the repo's own tools/serve.mjs, driven in
// real Chromium through tools/browser.mjs's CDP path — the same road every
// other driven tool here takes, and the road tools/screenshot.mjs does NOT take
// (it prints an 87 px white band and exits 0 under Chromium 141; a green from
// it means nothing). `--selftest` plants each known-bad as BYTES in the file the
// real defect would ship in and re-runs this whole tool against the copy.
//
// Usage:  node tools/armoury-picked-up.mjs
//         node tools/armoury-picked-up.mjs --selftest
// Exit:   0 all green · 1 any finding · 2 the harness could not run
//
// BOUNDARY, and it is the extent of the green. One Linux container, one
// headless Chromium, and — for A1/A2/A3 — ONE SHAPE (1200x730) and ONE BOARD:
// `?shot=combat`,
// which is the IN-COMBAT mount (inCombat: true). The map's Armoury is a second
// mount with a different `meta` and a live onChange, and NOTHING HERE SPEAKS
// FOR IT. A1's model half is shape-free and covers both; A2 and A3 are the
// combat mount only.
//
// REMOVAL CONDITION: deleted the day the Armoury stops being the shelf — if the
// picker ever moves off `ownership()`, A1 is measuring a predicate nobody reads.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// FINDING CODES — one closed set, read by BOTH the emitter and the plant, so the
// second copy never exists. Added 2026-08-21 after Saga's WITHHOLD at ea2cf89.
//
// WHAT BIT US, and it was my own rule from both ends. I wrote that an
// `expectRed` matching a check ID instead of a sentence is not a plant but a
// hope — /FAIL A1/ is satisfied by whichever of A1's three sub-checks happens to
// fire, so it catches something and measures nothing. That correction was right
// and it is kept. What it did NOT survive is the inverse: an `expectRed` bound
// to a SENTENCE dies silently the day the sentence is reworded. Both of A1's
// plants asserted prose this file no longer printed; the checks discriminated
// correctly in both directions and the corpus reported NOT CAUGHT anyway.
//
// THE ANCHOR, and why it cannot rot either way:
//   · A code names ONE ASSERTION IN ONE DIRECTION — `A1.wide` (the shelf offers
//     what the run never picked up) and `A1.step` (a pickup does not move the
//     shelf) are different codes, so a plant bound to one CANNOT be satisfied by
//     the other. That is the discrimination the sentence was bought for.
//   · The prose stays free. Reword any FAIL line and every plant still holds:
//     the code and the sentence are printed by ONE call, so they cannot drift
//     into two copies of the same fact.
//   · A plant naming a code this file cannot emit THROWS AT LOAD (`redRe`
//     below), so a rename is a hard red on the next run, never a silent green.
//     doorplant already gives the plant's FIND-STRING that guarantee; this gives
//     it to the assertion side, which is the half that was missing.
//
// REMOVAL CONDITION for the codes: deleted the day a plant is bound to something
// stronger than an output match — a structured findings array the harness reads.
// Then the string is the second copy and this block is the thing to cut.

      // key and pad origins and left the MOUSE one arming an eater with nothing
      // to eat — released only by the next `pointerdown`, so a player who
      // finishes a mouse hold and reaches for the keyboard loses one activation
      // anywhere on the page. Reproduced before the fix at 1200x730: window
      // click-capture listeners NET +1 after the lift, and the next Enter on the
      // Grid view tab left `data-view` at "hybrid".
      //
      // STILL DRIVEN AFTER THE FIX CHANGED SHAPE. The eater now ARMS on this
      // road and is simply never fed, so this stage is the one that proves the
      // armed-and-inert state really is inert. A check retired because its gate
      // was deleted would have been measuring the gate, not the road.
      //
      // THIS IS A7.swallow's ASSERTION WITH A MOUSE IN FRONT OF IT, and it is a
      // separate check because A6 reads `[]` after a mouse lift either way.

    //
    // Codex, 2026-08-22 (P2b), and it is a defect OF HIS RULING rather than a
    // nicety. D97 puts a SECOND control on every candidate; a second control
    // with no name is a worse screen-reader and voice-control surface than the
    // single one it joined, and that is not what he was shown when he ruled.
    //
    // READ OFF THE ACCESSIBILITY TREE, never the DOM. `data-hold-for` carries
    // the piece id and is NOT in that tree — that is the whole finding, so a
    // check that read the dataset would agree with itself and prove nothing.
    // `Accessibility.getFullAXTree` is the same tree a screen reader consumes.
    //
    // BOTH EDGES, and the max edge needs a bag: `?shot=map&shotStorage=full`
    // fills it through `addToStorage`, the real writer every drop enters, so
    // the eight candidates are the product's own, not an array this tool wrote.
    //   ONE candidate  — no sibling to be confused with; the name must still
    //                    carry the piece, because a lone `Equip` tells a blind
    //                    player nothing about what they are about to wear.
    //   MANY candidates — measured before the fix: 8 grips, AX names
    //                    ["Unequip HOLD","Equip HOLD" x7], 6 collisions.
    //
    // NOT THE IN-CARD CONTROL, AND THAT IS MEASURED TOO: the fold is an
    // ACCORDION. Clicking all eight faces left `aria-expanded="true"` on
    // exactly ONE, and a folded card's `.ep-equip` is absent from the AX tree
    // altogether. At most one in-card control exists at a time, inside the card
    // whose face carries the name — no sibling, no collision, nothing to name.
