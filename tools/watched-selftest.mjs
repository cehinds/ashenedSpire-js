// tools/watched-selftest.mjs — the known-bad corpus for tools/watched.mjs.
//
// Bjorn, 2026-08-08. *The instrument rule* (`commons/development.md`): a check
// whose failing case nobody has watched fail is `unknown`, not green. This audit
// exists because a board said `shipped` about a screen nobody had opened — so an
// audit that could not itself go red would be the same defect one level up, and
// it would be MY defect this time.
//
// Thirteen plants. Each mutates ONE thing — a probe, the ledger, the states, or
// (plant 14, deliberately) THE SOURCE THE PROBE WAS READ OUT OF — writes it to a
// temp dir, runs the REAL tool end-to-end against it, and requires the
// expected red. Nothing is faked in memory: the plants go through the same
// argument parsing, the same browser, the same verdict code as a real run.
//
//   1  not-there        a control that cannot be on the screen
//   2  unreachable      a screen whose door does not exist
//   3  unaccounted      a ledger row with no probe
//   4  stale            a probe for a row the ledger does not carry
//   5  there-but-wrong  a state expectation that must fail
//   6  source           a content pattern that cannot be found
//   7  FLOOR exit 2     a ledger with zero rows
//   8  FLOOR exit 2     a ledger whose rows are all in other states
//   9  FLOOR exit 2     a probe that names nobody in `by`
//  10  FLOOR exit 2     an `anchors` literal that is in none of its `read` files
//  11  FLOOR exit 2     a probe declaring no `anchors` at all
//  12  FLOOR exit 2     a `read` naming a file this tree does not contain
//  13  FLOOR exit 2     a typed `:LINE` back in a `read` (lines are DERIVED here)
//  14  FLOOR exit 2     THE SOURCE MOVES UNDER A CORRECT PROBE — the A5 case
//
// Run: node tools/watched.mjs --selftest --ledger <path-to-asks.json>
// Exit: 0 all of them observed red · 1 any plant came back GREEN (the bad news)
