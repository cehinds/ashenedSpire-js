// tools/buildstamp-shot-selftest.mjs — the known-bad corpus for the INK gate.
//
// A fresh instrument's first green is worth nothing (development.md's base
// rate: eleven instruments ran dead in one session and every one printed a
// plausible number). tools/buildstamp-shot.mjs is a fresh instrument. Until
// this file ran it was `unknown`, not green.
//
// ── THE DOOR ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every plant is a REAL EDIT to a real stylesheet or a real screen module, in a
// real tree, which is then SERVED and rendered in a real browser and driven by
// the whole program. Nothing is handed to a predicate: the defect enters where
// a defect of its class actually enters — a hand editing styles/ui.css — and
// travels the server, the module graph, the layout and the compositor before
// anything is asserted.
//
// ── WHY THESE SIX ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Four of them are Vira's list from 2026-08-15, the CSS routes that leave an
// element in the DOM and take its ink away. They are here BECAUSE a presence
// check passes all of them: `opacity: 0` and a stamp painted in the panel's own
// colour are invisible to every DOM predicate that could be written, and they
// are the two most ordinary ways this feature dies quietly. If the two crops
// were ever compared with the tolerance turned off, or the freeze forgotten,
// these are the plants that go green and tell us.
//
// The other two are the coarse failures — the placement deleted, and the stamp
// printing something it typed itself instead of what the tree derives.
//
