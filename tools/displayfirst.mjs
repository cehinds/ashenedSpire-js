// tools/displayfirst.mjs — FULLSCREEN IS THE FIRST THING A PLAYER MEETS UNDER
// DISPLAY, ON THE SCREEN, AT BOTH DOORS. The rendered check on E3 / #248.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS, and it is not that the ordering is broken — it is not.
//
// His words, 2026-08-15 (#248): "the full screen option toggle should be the
// first option in the display". PR #287 moved the row to the head of `ROWS` and
// landed `tests/engine.test.js` test 61 to hold the seat. That test reads
//
//     categoryHandler('Display').rows[0].key === 'fullscreen'
//
// which is an assertion about an ARRAY, and its own comment states the missing
// half as a fact rather than checking it: *"Order on the screen IS array order
// in ROWS — categoryHandler() filters without sorting, rowHtml renders in
// sequence."* That sentence is true today. Nothing in this repo watches it stay
// true, and three separate one-line edits make it false while test 61 stays
// green — each of them is a plant in the corpus below:
//
//   · the RENDERER reorders (`categoryHtml`'s `h.rows.map(...)`), leaving
//     `categoryHandler().rows` untouched;
//   · CSS hides the first row — it is still first in the array, and the first
//     control a player can SEE is the one behind it;
//   · CSS reverses the visual order of a DOM that never moved (`column-reverse`
//     / `order:`), which is the same shape as a box that "never moved" because
//     what moved was its parent.
//
// So this file is not a second copy of test 61. Test 61 asserts the TABLE; this
// asserts the SCREEN, and the two disagree exactly where the bugs live.
//
// THE BEFORE, MEASURED AT dev = 897d9fa BEFORE A LINE OF THIS EXISTED, so the
// claim "the ordering already holds" is a reading and not a hope. Four cells,
// title door and in-run door, 1440x860 and 390x844: `#set-panel` renders TWENTY
// Display rows, row 0 is `fullscreen` in every one, `display:flex`,
// `visibility:visible`, box 83.5 px tall wide / 64.4 px phone, top edge equal to
// the panel's own top, panel `scrollTop` 0. It is first, and it is INK.
//
// WHAT IT CHECKS, per cell:
//   D1 ORDER    the first Display control a player meets is `fullscreen`.
//               "First" is GEOMETRIC — visible rows sorted by rendered (top,
//               left) — never DOM order. A check that read DOM order would be
//               green under `flex-direction: column-reverse`, where every box
//               is where it always was and the player sees the list backwards.
//   D2 ONCE     exactly one `fullscreen` CONTROL is in the panel. A move that
//               copies is not a move. IT COUNTED ROWS UNTIL 2026-08-22, and a
//               row reports only its FIRST `[data-key]`: two Fullscreen toggles
//               rendered inside ONE `.set-row` gave `count=1` and passed. The
//               sentence said control, the predicate said container. Codex,
//               `:419`. Both numbers are printed now — `controls=N rows=M` —
//               because their divergence IS the defect.
//   D3 INK      that row AND THE CONTROL INSIDE IT are on screen ON ARRIVAL —
//               non-zero box, `display` not none, `visibility` exactly visible, not
//               transparent through ANY ancestor, and each box wholly inside the
//               viewport ON ALL FOUR EDGES, with nothing scrolled in ANY real
//               scrollable ancestor, nor on document Y or document X.
//               TWO BOXES SINCE 2026-08-22, and the second one is the sweep D2's
//               finding earned: this judged the `.set-row` and called it the
//               control. A toggle displaced, shrunk or faded INSIDE a row that
//               is exactly where it belongs left every number correct and the
//               control out of reach.
//               ANCESTOR OPACITY SINCE 2026-08-22 TOO: opacity neither inherits
//               nor collapses the box, so `.modal-veil { opacity: 0 }` left the
//               row at `opacity: 1`, full size, and this tool printed
//               `OK — 8 checks passed` over a panel nobody could see.
//               "First" that a player has to scroll to is not first.
//               NOTHING SCROLLED MEANT TWO AXES UNTIL 2026-08-22: `docX` was
//               read off the page and never reached the predicate, so a document
//               scrolled 500 px sideways printed "nothing scrolled" and exited
//               0. That is a FALSE PRINTED CLAIM rather than a demonstrated
//               false green — `.modal-veil` is fixed, so the row could not
//               actually be pushed off — and on this house's own test that is
//               the worse of the two, because nothing fails and the reader is
//               left confidently wrong.
//               THE FOUR EDGES ARE THE POINT, and this sentence was a lie for
//               one of them until 2026-08-22: the predicate named top, left and
//               bottom and never mentioned the RIGHT edge, so a row pushed
//               clean off the right of the viewport passed. Measured at the
//               real door, one plant per edge — left, top and bottom CAUGHT,
//               right UNCAUGHT with `OK — 2 cells passed`, exit 0. All four are
//               in the corpus now, so the sentence and the predicate name the
//               same set and each edge has been WATCHED to fail.
//   D4 DOORS    the title-screen modal and the in-run overlay give the SAME
//               answer at the same shape and text size. One home renders both
//               (`renderSettings`); a divergence means that stopped being true.
//   D0 POP      the declared cell count is reached, and a Display panel with NO
//               rows is RED. An empty population and a clean one look identical
//               to a check that only hunts for violations, and they mean the
//               opposite. AND THE DECLARED COUNT ITSELF MAY NOT BE ZERO:
//               `reached === expected` is self-satisfying at zero, so a zero
//               population is REFUSED (exit 2, UNKNOWN), never passed — and a
//               narrowing flag that matches nothing is refused before it can
//               produce one. See the `--only-*` block below for the run that
//               printed `OK — 1 checks passed` over no cells at all.
//
// BOTH EDGES, named because the gate requires it:
//   · EMPTY — Display with zero rows (plant 5). D0 goes red; nothing else may
//     report green over it.
//   · MAX — Text XL at the narrow shape where the panel is nearest to
//     overflowing. Its computed root font metric must exceed Text M; row height
//     is diagnostic only because a legitimate fixed/min-height can equalize it.
//
// THE THRESHOLD'S OWN NEIGHBOURHOOD (Charter 2b). The threshold here is ordinal
// position, and its unit is one row: plant 1 moves `fullscreen` exactly ONE
// position and the verdict flips, so there is a cell either side of the line,
// adjacent, and both enter by the same door as every other input — file bytes in
// a copied real tree.
//
// THE DOOR: the SOURCE TREE over http in headless Chromium (tools/serve.mjs).
// Text size is set through the game's own settings store (`?shotSettings`), the
// panel is opened by CLICKING the same controls a player clicks, and every box
// is read with `getBoundingClientRect()` off the live page. Nothing is injected
// and no module is imported to be asked a question. `--selftest` plants its
// known-bads as file bytes in a copied real tree (tools/doorplant.mjs) and runs
// this tool WHOLE from the copy — the same door, narrowed population declared in
// its own output.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER, and this is the boundary rather than a to-do:
//   · THE OTHER HALF OF HIS SENTENCE. "the menu settings need some work in look
//     and feel" is unspecified, unowned, and NOT ASSERTED ANYWHERE HERE. This
//     tool would be green on a settings screen he hates. It says one thing:
//     the first control under Display is the Fullscreen toggle, and you can see
//     it without scrolling.
//   · THE REMAINING ROWS. Only position 1 has an ask attached to it, so only
//     position 1 is held. The rest may be reordered freely.
//   · Linux headless Chromium, two shapes, two text sizes, two doors. Windows
//     and macOS are `unknown` here as everywhere else in this repo.
//   · IT IS WIRED INTO ci.yml's MANUAL Ubuntu browser job. One clean run
//     measures eight rendered cells; the selftest adds twenty-four copied-tree
//     browser plants across two focused corpora, including deliberate 25-second
//     and 30-second timeout defects. The workflow states that cost beside the
//     steps. Until an
//     exact-head dispatch finishes, this gate is `unknown`, not green.
//
// REMOVAL CONDITION (SOP 1's corollary): deleted the day #248's ordering ask is
// withdrawn or superseded by a different first row — in which case the ask moves
// and this file moves with it, it does not quietly widen. Also deleted if test
// 61 is ever replaced by a check that reads the rendered screen itself, since
// then this is the second copy.

//
// AND THE VALUE IS NOW VALIDATED, because a narrowing flag is the one input that
// can empty the population. Found by Marina 2026-08-22 at this line, reproduced
// here before the fix:
//
//   $ node tools/displayfirst.mjs --only-shape 1440x680     # typo for 860
//     ok  D0/population reached=0 declared=0 (0 shape(s) x 2 text size(s) x 2 doors)
//   · cells measured: 0 of 0 declared.
//   displayfirst: OK — 1 checks passed                       exit 0
//
// `expected` derives from the SAME filter that produces the cells, so
// `reached === expected` is SELF-SATISFYING AT ZERO — the check compares a
// number against itself and calls the agreement a pass.
//
// IT WALKS THROUGH #294's FLOOR, and the count is why: ONE check passed, not
// zero, and that one is the self-satisfying D0 line. `verdict.mjs`'s ZERO-WORK
// GREEN floor fires only at exactly 0, so wrapped in the real door this read
// `verdict: OK — verdict: 1 via [label: OK — N checks passed]`, exit 0.
//

//   · an unknown VALUE is refused before anything boots, by name, with the legal

//     The second does not depend on my having enumerated every narrowing axis,
//     which is the half that would rot when someone adds a third flag.
// Both exit 2 as `UNKNOWN — nothing was measured`, which #294's `readVerdict`
// reads as SILENCE and blocks on. Nothing measured is not a verdict.

// THE COUNTERS AND THE BOUNDARY LIVE AT MODULE SCOPE, AND THE REASON IS A
// MEASUREMENT ABOUT THIS FILE, NOT A STYLE PREFERENCE.
//
// Bjorn measured in #320 that 41 of 69 boundary-printing tools in this repo
// have an EXIT PATH ABOVE THEIR PRINT. This tool was one of them. Until
// 2026-08-22 the BOUNDARY block sat inside `main()` after the cell loop, and
// three paths reached an exit without ever passing it:
//
//   · `process.exit(2)` when no browser is found;
//   · the top-level `main().catch(...)`, which any throw takes — a navigation
//     that never settles, a door whose controls are gone, a dead server;
//   · consequently, EVERY run against a subject that will not boot.
//
// Planted and watched rather than assumed (corpus plant 10, below): a settings
// module that throws on load leaves the page blank, `until()` times out, and at
// `07ead53` that run printed a stack, exit 1, ZERO boundary lines and ZERO
// verdict lines. A tool that says nothing about its own limits exactly when it
// failed to measure anything is the "green wasn't clearance" shape inverted.
//
// So: counters at module scope, `printBoundary()` at module scope, and EVERY
// exit goes through `finish()`. `printBoundary()` is idempotent, so a path that
// is reached twice prints once.
//
// THE FAILURE-PATH LINE IS DELIBERATELY NOT VERDICT-SHAPED. #294's
// `readVerdict` reads a stream and returns the one terminated verdict line;
// `displayfirst: STOPPED — …` and `displayfirst: UNKNOWN — …` match no row in
// its grammar, so it returns `{error:'none'}` — SILENCE, which blocks. That is
// the correct reading of a run that measured nothing, and it is why those lines
// are shaped the way they are rather than merely worded that way. Checked
// against `readVerdict` itself, not eyeballed.
//
// THE GREEN LINE IS VERDICT-SHAPED, and it moved to get there: it used to read
// `OK — N cells passed; 0 findings`, which `readVerdict` also returns
// `{error:'none'}` for — prose after the counted claim is unrecognised grammar,
// by that door's contract. A green nobody can read is the same silence as a red
// nobody printed.

// in the same breath, on every state; `--selftest` did the same. On POSIX,
// Node's stdout is SYNCHRONOUS to a file or a TTY and ASYNCHRONOUS TO A PIPE.
// `process.exit()` does not drain a queued write. So the one line this gate
// promises on every exit path is exactly the line a pipe can eat.
//
// MEASURED, NOT REASONED, and it is not a race — it is deterministic once the
// pipe is full (Linux pipe buffer, 64 KiB; a reader stalled 300 ms):
//
//   bytes on stdout   process.exit()     process.exitCode
//   1 KiB             0/20 truncated     0/20

//   1 MiB            20/20 TRUNCATED     0/20
//
// SIZED HONESTLY, BECAUSE THE SIZING IS THE INTERESTING PART: this tool's own
// largest measured run is 5,207 bytes of stdout (the full 8-cell green), an
// order of magnitude under the buffer, so I could not produce a truncation from
// its own output on Linux. What CAN produce one is a CONSUMER whose pipe is
// already full — a log collector, a `tee`, a CI step reading two streams — and
// that is the corpus's flush plant below, which fills the pipe first and then
// requires the terminal line to survive. So: a real defect, watched, whose
// exposure today is a slow consumer rather than this tool's own verbosity.
//
// AND THE OTHER HALF, WHICH IS WHY THIS IS NOT A ONE-WORD CHANGE. `process.exit`
// was also doing a second job nobody wrote down: killing a process that
// `serve.mjs`'s HTTP server and a live Chromium would otherwise hold open.
// Removing it without `shutdown()` converts every truncation into a HANG — the
// same defect in a worse coat, since a hang prints nothing at all. So the exits
// are ordered: close what we opened, print, set `process.exitCode`, return, and
// let the loop drain and end by itself. `forceExitAfterDrain` is the backstop
// for a handle nobody accounted for, and it arms ONLY AFTER both streams have
// flushed — never before, because that would be the truncation again.

// EVERY COMMAND HAS TO COME BACK, OR SAY THAT IT DID NOT. A HANG IS THE SAME
// DEFECT AS A BLANK BAND IN A DIFFERENT COAT — Sunna's sentence, 2026-08-22,
// after her screenshot harness hung forever on `Page.captureScreenshot` and two
// runs died having photographed four screens and reported nothing about the six
// they missed.
//
// THE DEFECT, at this line until 2026-08-22 (Codex, `:351`): a promise went into
// `pending` and ONLY a matching `message` event ever took it out. There was no
// close handler, no error handler and no timeout. So there were two ways to
// suspend `main()` forever, and neither printed anything:
//
//   1. THE SOCKET DIES. Chromium crashes or the DevTools socket drops after the
//      command is sent and before the reply arrives. No message ever comes.
//   2. THE SOCKET LIVES AND THE REPLY DOES NOT. The renderer is blocked, so
//      `Runtime.evaluate` is queued behind a main thread that never yields.
//      **This is Sunna's shape, and it is the one a close handler does NOT
//      cover** — the socket is perfectly healthy the whole time.
//
// Either way `main()` never settles, `serve.mjs`'s HTTP server keeps the loop
// alive, and this hand-run gate hangs WITHOUT printing the STOPPED line and the
// boundary it promises on every exit path. A gate that hangs is read as a slow
// gate, not a failing one; nobody re-runs it and nothing goes red.
//
// BOTH DOORS ARE CLOSED HERE, because they are two different failures:
//   · close/error rejects EVERY pending command by name and poisons the socket,
//     so a command issued after the death fails immediately instead of joining
//     a queue nothing will ever drain;
//   · each command carries its own timeout, which is the ONLY thing that
//     catches case 2. Watched, not asserted: corpus plant 14 blocks the page's
//     main thread and the run reaches STOPPED naming this timeout.
//
// The bound is generous on purpose — the slowest legitimate command here is an
// `awaitPromise` evaluate that clicks through two menus with ~1.6 s of waits
// inside it. 30 s is 18x that. It is a deadline, not a performance budget.

// --selftest — the same-door known-bad corpus.
//
// TWENTY-FOUR FILE-BYTE PLANTS ACROSS TWO CORPORA, PLUS PLANT 15, WHICH IS A
// CONDITION AND NOT A FILE.
// THREE OF THEM ARE INVISIBLE TO test 61, and that is the argument for this file
// existing at all: plants 2, 3 and 4 leave `ROWS` and
// `categoryHandler('Display').rows` exactly as they are, so the engine suite
// stays green while the screen is wrong.
//
// PLANTS 6-9 are one per viewport edge — D3's four-edge sentence, watched to
// fail at each edge rather than asserted. PLANT 11 is the third scroll axis,
// which the predicate read and never used. PLANT 13 is the ancestor nobody
// asked about: `opacity: 0` on a door's `.modal-veil`, where every box is real,
// every box is first, and nobody can see any of it.
//
// PLANTS 16 AND 17 ARE THE CONTAINER SWEEP, and they are here because the same
// mistake had now been made three times in this one file: a predicate measuring
// the thing NEXT TO the noun its own sentence uses. 16 renders the Fullscreen
// control twice inside one row, which a row-count cannot see; 17 pushes the
// control 4000 px sideways inside a row that never moves, which a row-rect
// cannot see. Both were green before 2026-08-22.
//
// PLANTS 10, 12, 14 AND 15 ARE NOT ABOUT THE SCREEN AT ALL — they are about
// whether THIS TOOL still speaks when it cannot measure. 10 makes the subject
// unreachable and requires the BOUNDARY and a non-verdict-shaped state line to
// print anyway; 12 removes the panel and requires the run to reach its intended
// FAIL with both cells, rather than dying in its own diagnostic and reporting
// SILENCE; 14 blocks the renderer so a CDP command is sent and never answered,
// which is a HANG — the only one of these four that used to print nothing at
// all, not even a wrong thing; 15 hands the run a full pipe and a stalled reader
// and requires the terminal line to arrive whole.
//
// A COUNT IS NOT A GUARANTEE, and this corpus is the evidence for that sentence:
// plant 10 counted for a week while asserting the symptom instead of the thing
// it guards (see its own comment). A corpus counts plants; NOTHING IN THIS HOUSE
// COUNTS WHETHER A PLANT ASSERTS WHAT IT CLAIMS TO PROTECT. The check for that
// is mutation — break the guarded behaviour, leave the defect, and require the
// corpus to go red — and it is caught by hand today, twice tonight (this plant
// and #320's headline plant). Recorded here as a gap; not built here.

      //     would not have moved the Display panel at all: GREEN on a plant that
      //     must be red.
      //   · THEN I LIFTED THE ROW OUT AND PUT IT BACK BEHIND `accent`, which is
      //     one position — and measured `first=titleCityHold`, with `fullscreen`
      //     absent from the panel and D2 and D3 firing too. Removing the FIRST

// ordinary CI log collector, a `| tee`, a wrapper reading two streams.
//
// WHAT IT GUARDS: the complete terminal line, on the exit path this tool
// promises to print one on. `process.exit()` does not drain a queued write, so
// before 2026-08-22 this gate could print its boundary and its verdict into a
// pipe and die with both still in the queue — silence, from the tool whose
// entire argument is that silence is the defect.
//
// IT CARRIES ITS OWN BOTH EDGES, EVERY RUN, and that is deliberate. Plant 10
// counted for a week while asserting the symptom instead of the thing it
// guards, and the check for that is mutation. So this plant MUTATES THE REAL
// TOOL BACK — `process.exitCode` + return replaced by `process.exit(code)`, the
// pre-fix bytes — and requires the mutant to LOSE the line before it will
// believe the fixed tool KEPT it. A run where both survive means the pipe never
// filled and the plant proved nothing; that is a hard red here, not a pass.
//
// THE DOOR: a real subprocess (`node tools/displayfirst.mjs --only-shape
// 1440x680`, the cheap exit-2 path — no browser, no server) run from a COPY of
// tools/, its stdout and stderr joined onto one pipe by the shell, read by a
// consumer that sleeps 400 ms first. The 256 KiB of filler is written by the
// WRAPPER, not by the tool: the plant supplies the full pipe, never fake output
// from the subject.
//
// MEASURED, so the sizing is not a mood: with the reader stalled, the mutant
// loses the line 20/20 at 64 KiB, 256 KiB and 1 MiB, and 0/20 at 1 KiB; the
// fixed form keeps it 0/20 truncated at every one of those sizes. This tool's
// own largest run is 5,207 bytes, well under a Linux pipe buffer — which is why
// the exposure is a full-pipe consumer and not this tool's verbosity, and why
// the plant fills the pipe rather than making the tool shout.
