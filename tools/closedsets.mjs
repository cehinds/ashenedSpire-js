//
// ONE QUESTION: does an exported closed set have a READER other than its own
// declaration? A vocabulary nothing reads is decoration — and decoration is
// worse than nothing, because it is what an author will edit INSTEAD of the
// thing that actually enforces the rule.
//
// ITS FIRST RUN, against dev cd3da94, before a line of this branch's collapse:
// 65 sets, SIX of them read by nothing — five more than the one I was looking
// for. That is the whole argument for a derived population over a list a person
// remembers to keep:
//
//   PASSIVE_KEYS      no reader in the tree; the relic schema re-typed the same
//                     seven names by hand and did the refusing (#131 collapses it)
//   MODIFIER_KEYS     imported into validate.js and used for NOTHING, while
//                     modifiersSchema re-typed the same nine names
//   PILES / PILE_POSITIONS
//                     no reader; validate.js:807 and :811 re-typed both as
//                     inline literals
//   ALL_MODS          no reader at all — a union nobody ever wanted
//   M1_GAUNTLET       the M1 acceptance walk, re-exported through the content
//                     barrel and consumed by nothing since M2
//
//   $ node tools/closedsets.mjs          # at cd3da94
//   RESULT: 65 exported closed set(s) over 103 source file(s); … 6 with no reader.
//   exit 1
//
// Marina asked for the general form of that finding, so this is it: the
// population is derived from the tree (never a list I type here), the floor is
// that an empty population is a FINDING and not a pass, and the failing case has
// been observed — `--selftest`.
//
// WHAT A READER IS, precisely, because the definition is the whole check:
//   · a mention of the name in EXECUTABLE CODE — comments and string literals
//     are blanked before scanning. `// SPEC PASSIVE_KEYS` in a comment is how
//     that set looked alive for a month.
//   · at any site other than the declaration itself, in src/, tools/ or tests/.
//   · AN IMPORT IS NOT A READER. A name inside `import { … }` / `export { … }`
//     specifiers is ceremony; MODIFIER_KEYS had exactly one such line and
//     nothing else, which is a dead import wearing a vocabulary's clothes.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT ASK, and the boundary is printed in its own output: it
// cannot see whether a SECOND, hand-typed copy of a set exists somewhere. Green
// here means "every closed set is read by something", never "no set is
// duplicated". Finding the duplicate is still a person's job — this only kills
// the half where the duplicate is the only thing that works.
//
// Run:  node tools/closedsets.mjs             the tree — exit 1 on findings
//       node tools/closedsets.mjs --selftest  the corpus — exit 1 if a plant survives
//       node tools/closedsets.mjs --json      the table, machine-readable
// Exit 2 = the check had nothing to rule on (SOP 2's ⚙ clause).
