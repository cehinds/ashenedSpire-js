// tools/watched.mjs — did anyone OPEN THE BUILD and SEE the control?
//
// Bjorn, 2026-08-08. Saga's ledger (`commons/tools/asks.json`, family repo)
// prints its own boundary over its `state` column: **`shipped` means a commit is
// an ancestor of `dev`. It does not mean anyone opened the screen.** That gap is
// not academic. It is how the fog reached Constantine SWITCHED OFF behind a
// setting nobody told him about, while a board said it existed and walked; and
// the same evening it produced a second false report — the thirty-minute-run
// knobs described as "three knobs on a screen that exists", with `floors` and
// `columns` occurring zero times in `src/ui/screens/customRun.js`.
//
// Marina's standing rule, and this file is its machine:
//
//   > A feature is not done until whoever reports it has watched it running in
//   > the state the reader will open it in.
//
// WHAT IT DOES. For every row of the ledger in a watched-worthy state, it opens
// the SHIPPED BUNDLE (`dist/AshenSpire.html` — the file he actually opens) at
// 390x844, drives real clicks to the screen the control lives on, asserts the
// control is there, and writes a PNG of it. Every row gets a verdict:
//
//   watched          the control was on the screen named, and here is the picture
//   not-there        the screen opened and the control was not on it
//   there-but-wrong  the control is there and the state he would open it in is not
//   unreachable      the screen could not be opened — A FINDING, NOT A SKIP
//   unaccounted      THE LEDGER HAS THIS ROW AND THIS INSTRUMENT HAS NO PROBE
//   no-screen        declared by a person as having no build surface, with a reason
//
// THE POPULATION IS DERIVED, NEVER TYPED. It is read out of the ledger passed on
// `--ledger`, filtered by state. A row this instrument cannot account for comes
// out RED and BY NAME (`unaccounted`) — it is never absent, because a list that
// can silently shrink is the defect this house is named for. Symmetrically, a
// probe naming a row the ledger no longer carries is red too: drift has two signs.
//
// WHO DREW EVERY EDGE. Every probe in `tools/watched-probes.json` carries `by`
// (the person who chose its selector, its reach and its expectation), `read`
// (the source FILES the selector was READ out of, not guessed) and `anchors`
// (literal strings from those files whose disappearance means the derivation is
// dead). A probe missing any of the three is a floor failure, not a warning — a
// shape list and a tolerance are the same object, and an unsigned one is an
// opinion wearing a number.
//
// AMENDED 2026-08-22 (Bjorn), and the amendment is the point: `read` used to be
// checked for being NON-EMPTY and nothing else, so a probe could cite a deleted
// file or a symbol that had moved and this tool printed `watched` beside it. See
// THE READ FLOOR below for the measurement that produced the rule. `anchors` is
// a second copy of a fact — deliberately, because a citation IS one, and the
// only thing that makes a second copy safe is something checking the two agree.
// That check is what did not exist.
//
// WHAT THIS GREEN DOES NOT COVER, said before it is cited:
//   · It proves the control was ON SCREEN in the shipped bundle at this shape.
//     It does not prove the control WORKS, and it is not a person's eyes. It
//     hands a picture to a person whose name goes in the report. `watched` here
//     means "photographable in the state he opens it in", one rung below "played".
//   · One shape by default (390x844 — his words: "mobile might need to be the
//     priority for now"), one browser, one Linux box.
//   · A `no-screen` row is a PERSON's claim that an ask has no build surface. It
//     is printed by name, excluded from the watched count, and never green.
//
// IT ALSO AUDITS THE COMMITTED PICTURES, in the same run and under the same
// rule, because a screenshot that outlives its build is a receipt: every png in
// `docs/preview/` whose last commit is behind the last commit touching `src/` or
// `styles/` is named as STALE, and every `?shot=` state declared in `src/main.js`
// with no committed picture is named as NEVER PICTURED. Both halves derived —
// the pictures from the folder, the denominator from main.js's own
// `shotState === '...'` comparisons. (Viki's note on the co-op collapse: the
// preview shots "still show the old 27 px map until whoever owns the shots
// re-runs the harness." That is this file's subject wearing a picture.)
//
// KNOWN-BAD FIRST (development.md, *The instrument rule*). `--selftest` requires
// every planted outcome below to be observed before this file may be cited as
// coverage: a control that cannot be there, a screen that cannot open, a ledger
// row with no probe, a probe for a row the ledger dropped, a state expectation
// that must fail, a content pattern that cannot match, zero rows, an empty
// population, an unsigned probe, a dead anchor, a probe with no anchors, a
// `read` naming a deleted file, a typed line number, source movement under a
// correct probe, and parameter movement under both tight and loose anchors. A
// check that names a thing it cannot fail on is a receipt.
//
// Usage:
//   node tools/watched.mjs --ledger <path-to-asks.json> [--shape 390x844]
//                          [--only G7,S3] [--src] [--dump] [--out DIR]
//   node tools/watched.mjs --selftest --ledger <path-to-asks.json>
//   node tools/watched.mjs --check-reads          (the read floor alone; no browser)
// Exit: 0 every row watched or declared · 1 any red · 2 the harness could not run
//
// REMOVAL CONDITION: deleted the day the ledger's `state` column is itself
// derived from a run of this file — then the two are one fact with one home and
// this is the copy. Also deleted if it is ever green while a row it called
// `watched` turns out not to be on the screen it named.

// ---- THE READ FLOOR: a derivation that no longer exists must not read green --
//
// Bjorn, 2026-08-22. Codex found the hole on #316 and the probe it found was
// mine (A5). The probe is not the finding. THIS IS: until today `readProbes`
// checked that `read` was NON-EMPTY and nothing else, so a probe could name a
// file that had been deleted, a line past the end of it, or a symbol that no
// longer existed, and this tool would print `watched` beside it. **The
// instrument whose whole job is catching probe rot could not tell a live
// derivation from a dead one.**
//
// MEASURED BEFORE IT WAS FIXED — AND THE FIGURES ARE DERIVED BY THIS TOOL, NOT
// TYPED HERE, BECAUSE FOUR OF THEM WERE TYPED HERE AND THREE OF THOSE WERE WRONG.
//
//     node tools/watched.mjs --census-citations <corpus.json>
//
// Saga blocked #320 for exactly this and she was right: I published `41 of 69`,
// `24 of 47`, `17 of 73` and a `.end-turn` drift of `1161`, and a reader could
// not re-derive one of them, because the counting rule lived in my head. A
// census whose rule is remembered is the disease this file is about, committed
// in the file that is about it. The command above prints the RULE beside every
// number it prints, so the next reader gets the same answer or a different rule
// they can name. Run it against `897d9fa:tools/watched-probes.json` for the
// before-picture.
//
// WHAT SURVIVED RE-DERIVATION, and it is the finding: over the 47 probes that
// owe a `read`, THIRTY-TWO carry at least one citation that does not resolve —
// and 32 is the same under all three extraction rules below, which is why it is
// the number this floor is argued from. Three named a symbol that is not in the
// cited file AT ALL (`.map-zoom` and its three buttons left `map.js` for
// `mapboard.js`; `data-hold-action` left `holdconfirm.js`), one named a line
// past the end of its file (`map.js:534`, 309 lines long) and one named a file
// this repo does not contain. **Not one of those was red.**
//
// WHAT IT NOW REQUIRES, and why each is the cheapest rule that can go red:
//
//   1  `read` names FILES, and every file it names must EXIST.
//   2  `read` may not carry a C1 STRICT citation: a path with an extension plus
//      `:LINE`. A line number is DERIVED from the anchor below and PRINTED by
//      this tool. A typed one is a second home for a fact the machine already
//      holds — Law 0 clause 4. The exact count and its rule:
//      `--census-citations`. Forms this floor does not recognise are named in
//      every `--check-reads` boundary instead of being claimed as covered.
//   3  every probe that owes a `read` declares `anchors`: LITERAL strings, each
//      of which must occur in at least one file the `read` names. An anchor is
//      the identity of the derivation — the symbol, selector, key or content
//      string the probe was built from. When it goes, the derivation is dead
//      and this floor is red BY NAME.
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT, said before it is cited. It is a CONSISTENCY check, not a
// correctness one (my own card, failure 3): it proves the probe still points at
// something that exists. It does not prove the probe points at the RIGHT thing,
// and it never will — that is what `by` is for, and `by` is a person. An anchor
// chosen loose enough to survive anything is a green that means nothing, and
// this floor cannot detect one; it can only be planted against by whoever picks
// it. **I picked a loose one myself while measuring this** — a scraped `FOLDED`
// matched an unrelated comment 26 lines away and turned A5's own rot green in
// my scratch harness. That is why anchors are DECLARED and never scraped.
//
// Run it alone — no browser, no ledger, no bundle:
//   node tools/watched.mjs --check-reads
// THE TYPED-LINE FLOOR IS C1 STRICT. The census still prints C2 and C3 to
// measure the historical corpus, but those wider extraction rules are not this
// refusal. Saga and Marina planted the distinction at `dbebb57`: orphan bare
// `:N`, extensionless `path:N`, and bare continuations left after the first C1
// citation loses its line all pass this floor. That is a false-green boundary,
// stated in every run below; it is not rewritten as coverage by calling C1 C2.

// exit a full run would take — one home for the rule, two doors to it.
// ---- THE CITATION CENSUS — the rule is PRINTED, so the number is re-derivable --
//
// Added 2026-08-22 by Bjorn, because Saga blocked #320 on the one thing that
// deserved it: three of my four headline figures did not re-derive, and the
// reason was that no artifact stated the counting rule. She got 67, 76 and 80
// for one figure of mine that read 73 — which is not two people disagreeing, it
// is two people measuring different things and both being right.
//
// So the rule is a first-class printed object here. THREE EXTRACTION RULES,
// named, each counted, because a corpus of hand-written prose has no single
// honest tokenisation:
//
//   C1  STRICT       a path WITH an extension, then `:N` or `:N-M`.
//   C2  + CONT       C1 plus a BARE `:N` that inherits the nearest path to its
//                    left (`statuses.js:73-93 (…) · :156-162 (…)`).
//   C3  + COMMA      C2 plus each extra number in `path:N,M`.
//
// AND ONE RESOLUTION PREDICATE, stated because it is the half that moves most:
// a citation RESOLVES iff at least one literal token (>=4 chars, not a bare
// number, not a stop-word) drawn from the prose that FOLLOWS it — up to the next
// ` · ` — occurs inside lines N..M of the file it names, read from THIS tree.
//
// THE HONEST HEADLINE IS THE RULE-INVARIANT ONE. The citation totals move with
// the extraction rule (67 / 75 / 79 on the pre-fix corpus) and the resolve count
// moves with the predicate. The count of PROBES carrying at least one dead
// citation does not: it is the same under all three. That is the number to
// argue from, and it is the one this census prints last.
