// tools/music-silence-probe.mjs — headless proof that the engine can tell
// silence-by-intent from silence-by-bug (word 3; Sunna's lift condition).
//
// Three shapes, three verdicts, through the REAL engine on the stubbed
// WebAudio graph (tools/webaudio-stub.mjs):
//   1. a context with a bed        → 'bed',     gain values scheduled
//   2. a context spelled 'silence' → 'silence', ZERO gain values scheduled —
//      the bed that was playing stops, nothing new starts: actual quiet,
//      and the engine SAYS it is deliberate
//   3. a context with no bed       → 'unknown', zero gain values AND a
//      console.warn naming the context — the bug shape, loud, never mistaken
//      for a decision
//
// Usage:   node tools/music-silence-probe.mjs             # the three shapes
//          node tools/music-silence-probe.mjs --selftest  # known-bad: delete
//            a bed the game relies on and prove shape 1's check goes red (the
//            instrument rule: a check nobody has watched fail is not green).
//
// Exit 0 = all three shapes give their verdict; 1 = any confusion.
// Nothing here has ears — this is the scheduling graph, not loudness.
// REMOVAL CONDITION: delete when music() no longer reports dispositions or
// the silence word leaves the vocabulary (MUSIC_SILENCE_WORD, model/schemas.js).
