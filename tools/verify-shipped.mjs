// tools/verify-shipped.mjs — verify the file a PLAYER is handed, not the file the
// bundler just wrote.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS — the guard that could not see the shipped artifact
// -----------------------------------------------------------------
// tools/bundle.mjs already names this bug in prose ("the art-less-build bug",
// around :141-152) and prints a guard for it:
//
//     if (mapEntries === 0) console.log('  WARNING: no art inlined — …');
//
// Two defects in one line. It reads `mapEntries`, a variable in its own process,
// about the build it is in the middle of writing — so it is structurally
// incapable of seeing the player-facing copies, which the README hands to a player. And it
// is a console.log: bundle.mjs exits 0 either way, so nothing is gated on it.
// At 40c5b21 the guard was green on every run while dist/AshenSpire.html had
// `indexOf('ASSET_MAP')` === -1 — it had never run that bundler at all.
//
// A guard that cannot see the shipped file and cannot fail is not a guard. This
// tool reads files off disk, exits non-zero, and proves it can fail with
// --selftest against a corpus that includes THE REAL STALE ARTIFACT, pulled out
// of this repo's own history by blob id. A synthesized known-bad is my opinion
// about the defect; the blob is the defect.
//
//   node tools/verify-shipped.mjs             verify the working tree
//   node tools/verify-shipped.mjs --selftest  run the known-bad corpus
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT CHECK, and this is the point of the chain:
//   root + dist carry art  +  both === build  →  the player's files are this source.
// Check B alone would pass on two identically art-less files, so A is what makes
// the chain terminate in a true claim rather than in agreement. Agreement is not
// synchronization (SOP 5).
//
// SINCE 2026-09-26 NONE OF THESE FILES IS TRACKED ON dev. The Git LFS budget ran
// out (every rebuild uploaded ~284 MB), so the built HTML is ignored, CI builds it
// on every push, and dev-preview.yml uploads it as the workflow artifact a player
// or tester downloads. This tool still verifies what that artifact is made of —
// the files tools/launch.mjs just wrote — and check C now also refuses any of them
// being TRACKED again, which is the LFS defect coming back through `git add`.
//
// REMOVAL CONDITION (SOP 1's corollary): deleted if bundle.mjs stops inlining art into a
// single file, because then check A is asserting a property the build no longer
// claims. NOT removed for having passed a long time: --selftest is what keeps it
// honest, and a --selftest that stops failing on the corpus is itself the alarm.

// reasons that are not this defect. She fed the old boolean `ASSET_MAP + 1 image`
// and it passed; the historical blob had exactly 3 images, so the missing token was
// the only thing that ever caught it.
//
// WHERE I DEPART FROM HER NUMBER, and she should rule on it rather than inherit it:
// she specified 97 (98 files under assets/ minus manifest.json). I made it a FLOOR
// of 64, not an equality of 97, because an equality here is two values that must
// stay equal — SOP 5's whole subject — and the day someone legitimately adds or
// removes a sprite, CI goes red for a true reason nobody wants and the fix is to
// retype the number. A floor cannot be fixed by retyping it upward without lying on
// purpose. 64 is far below the real 97 and far above the defect class it has to
// catch: the stale blob had 3, and a sparse checkout or an unfetched LFS pointer
// gives you a handful. If she wants the equality instead, it is one constant.
//
// REMOVAL CONDITION: the floor goes back to a boolean the day an ASSET_MAP cannot be
// partially populated — i.e. if bundle.mjs ever fails hard on a missing asset
// instead of writing a thinner map. It is RAISED only when the real count drops
// below it, never to track the count upward: a floor that follows the population is
// the equality this replaced.

// deleted: she fed it nine twin shapes and it caught one. It is load-bearing rather
// than cosmetic because checks A and B read ONLY dist/AshenSpire.html, so a tracked
