// tools/zoomunits.mjs — one coordinate space, one home.
//
// The whole UI is scaled by `--ui-zoom` (styles/base.css, `body { zoom: var(--ui-zoom, 1) }`,
// set in main.js applyUiScale). That makes two pixel units live in this codebase:
//
//   VISUAL px — what getBoundingClientRect() and pointer events report.
//   LOCAL  px — what an inline `style.left/top/width/height` is interpreted in.
//
// They differ by exactly the zoom factor, and the conversion between them has ONE
// home: `anchorLocalBox()` in src/ui/fx.js. This check finds every place a VISUAL
// value reaches a LOCAL px write without going through it.
//
// THE PREMISE IS MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED. tests/fixtures/zoomunits/two-spaces-probe.html
// writes 100 local px into a fixed, an absolute and a layer child under zoom 1.5
// and asks the browser where each landed. All three land at 150, and reading a
// rect then writing it straight back drifts 150 -> 225. Re-run:
//
//   /opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194/chrome-linux/chrome --headless --disable-gpu \
//     --no-sandbox --virtual-time-budget=2000 --dump-dom \
//     file://$PWD/tests/fixtures/zoomunits/two-spaces-probe.html
//
// That matters because `position: fixed` looks like it should escape an ancestor's
// zoom, and if it did, half the findings below would be false positives. It does
// not escape it. I checked before I believed it.
//
// WHAT THIS PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT.
// This is a CONSISTENCY check, not a CORRECTNESS check. It proves a second copy of
// fx.js's transform exists and differs from it. It cannot tell you whether any
// given site renders visibly wrong — that needs a browser at a real zoom, and it
// says so on every run, including the clean ones.
//
// Why it exists: at 40c5b21 five call sites used anchorLocalBox and one file
// open-coded it. That one file was the first-run tutorial, and the mispositioned
// callout locked a new player out of their first fight (fixed in 3a0def9, Rune).
// One fact, one home, one deviant — so the check is a detector plus the known-bad
// corpus that proves it (development.md SOP 3), not a line in a review checklist.
//
// THE CARRIED SET (added by Rune at the dev merge; Bjorn's instrument, his ruled
// shape). It held nine unconverted writes at four sites that predated this check.
// Left as a bare red they made the suite permanently red, which trains a reader to
// skip the line — and a red that is always there cannot tell you a TENTH site just
// arrived. **It is EMPTY as of 2026-07-28: all nine were fixed, not edited out
// (EldenSpire#15 — see the set itself for what left and where it went).** The
// mechanism stays because the next site to arrive needs somewhere to be counted.
// The set is recorded and asserted EXACTLY:
//
//   a finding not in the set        → red. Something new carries the bug.
//   an entry with no finding        → red. It was fixed or edited; delete its
//                                     line here in the SAME commit (that is the
//                                     set's upkeep rule, and it enforces itself).
//   an entry for a write THIS CHANGE introduced → red, and the discharge is to FIX
//                                     the write, never to edit the ledger. Checked
//                                     at git merge-base origin/dev HEAD; a base
//                                     that will not resolve is UNKNOWN, not clean.
//                                     (Vira's ratchet, ruled over a literal count:
//                                     "carried" MEANS predates this change.)
//   every entry matched, nothing new → 0, and every entry still prints, every run
//                                     (`held.length`, never a literal — see the
//                                     RESULT line at the foot of main()).
//
// Keyed on file + the write's own text, NEVER on line numbers: src/main.js moved
// 79 lines between 082860c and this ref (#8's ?shot= gate, #10's ?shotSettings=
// seeding) while every one of these writes stayed byte-identical. A baseline
// pinned to line numbers is a `red-at <old ref>` read against a newer tree.
// `--raw` restores the original verdict — any finding is red, no set consulted.
//
// Usage
//   node tools/zoomunits.mjs [<path> ...]   scan files/dirs (default: src/)
//   node tools/zoomunits.mjs --selftest     run the known-bad/known-good corpus
//   node tools/zoomunits.mjs --raw          ignore the carried set: any finding is red
//
// Exit codes
//   0  the carried set matched exactly, nothing new, every entry admissible
//      (or --raw: no finding at all)
//   1  a NEW finding, a VANISHED entry, an INADMISSIBLE entry, or a corpus miss
//      under --selftest
//   2  UNKNOWN — the admissibility base would not resolve, or a usage error. Never
//      a pass: unknown blocks (SOP 2), it is not the softer bucket.
//
// REMOVAL CONDITION (development.md SOP 1's corollary). Delete this file, its
// fixtures and its wiring in tests/run-node.mjs when EITHER holds:
//   (a) `zoom:` is gone from styles/base.css and `--ui-zoom` from src/ — the two
//       spaces have collapsed into one and there is nothing left to convert; or
//   (b) `--selftest` reports known-bad recall below 3/3 OR known-good cleared
//       below 4/4, and it cannot be restored by fixing the check. A detector whose
//       own corpus escapes it is decoration; delete the check, not the fixtures.
//       Both numbers move with the SELFTEST table below — if you add a fixture,
//       update this line in the same commit or the condition stops being
//       evaluable, which is the same as not having one.
// It is NOT removed merely because the repo goes clean — clean is the state it is
// for.
