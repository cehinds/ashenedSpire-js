// tools/doorplant.mjs — the same-door selftest harness: plant a known-bad in a
// COPY OF THE REAL TREE, run the tool whole from that copy, watch it go red.
//
// WHY. Vira's doors audit (docs/TOOL-DOORS-AUDIT.md, vira/the-doors-audited,
// 2026-08-14) classified 37 asserting tools with no re-runnable red and named
// the recurring defect: a plant handed to the acceptance predicate downstream
// of the readFileSync / import / serve road the real input travels. The
// instrument rule's same-door clause (commons/development.md, family repo):
// the known-bad must enter where the real input enters, and the check states
// its door in its own output. This harness is the one home of that mechanic
// for the tools that read THIS TREE — closedsets.mjs proved the pattern
// (plants written into a copied real tree on disk, read back through the same
// collect()); this generalizes it to a whole-tool subprocess run.
//
// WHAT IT DOES, per plant:
//   1. copies the real tree (src/, content/, styles/, tools/*.mjs, index.html)
//      to a scratch dir — the copy IS a runnable checkout;
//   2. edits the named file in the copy — the plant enters as FILE BYTES in
//      the same file the real defect would live in;
//   3. runs `node tools/<tool>` with cwd = the copy, so every stage the real
//      run performs (readFileSync, import graph, serve.mjs, the browser boot
//      for browser tools) runs against the planted bytes;
//   4. requires a non-zero exit AND an output line matching the plant's
//      expected red — a red for the wrong reason is NOT a catch;
//   5. restores the pristine bytes (the revert is discarding the edit; the
//      real tree was never touched), and finally re-runs CLEAN, which must be
//      green — both edges, every time.
//
// A plant whose find-string no longer exists is a HARD RED (`plant site
// drifted`), never a skip — a corpus that silently stops running is the
// eleven-instruments shape (gracerefill's legacy corpus, the same audit).
//
// HARNESS, not a check: this file asserts nothing about the game. Its callers
// do. It is exercised — observed red — every time a tool's selftest runs,
// because a NOT-CAUGHT plant exits 1 by this file's own hand.
//
// REMOVAL CONDITION: deleted the day the suite runner grows a per-test door
// harness that subsumes it, or the last tool selftest importing it is deleted.

// LINE ENDINGS ARE NOT PART OF THE PLANT (2026-09-17). Plants are authored with
// `\n`, because that is what the committed blobs carry and what Linux CI checks
// out. A Windows checkout under `core.autocrlf=true` hands copyTree a CRLF
// working tree, so an exact `bytes.includes(find)` on a MULTI-LINE find-string
// can never match — every authored `\n` faces a `\r\n` in the file. The corpus
// then reported PLANT SITE DRIFTED for plants whose site had not moved an inch:
// a false red on Windows, invisible on Linux, and indistinguishable in the
// output from the real drift the hard-red exists to catch. Single-line plants
// were unaffected, which is why it looked arbitrary.
//
// The fix is to treat EOLs as a property of the CHECKOUT, not of the plant:
// re-express `find`/`replace` in the target file's own line ending before
// matching, and write the replacement back in that same ending so the planted
// file stays internally consistent. `plantsites.mjs` already decided this for
// the static scan (it compares LF-normalised views); this is the same rule at
// the stage that actually edits bytes.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO: it does not widen matching. The as-authored bytes are
// still tried, a find-string that is absent in BOTH forms is still the same
// hard PLANT SITE DRIFTED, and on an LF tree every candidate collapses to the
// authored string — Linux CI behaves byte-for-byte as it did before.

 *
 * A browser corpus runs its plants one after another, a browser boot each, and

 *
 * The assignment is plant INDEX modulo COUNT — the rule tools/buildversion-
 * selftest.mjs already used — so it is deterministic, needs no table, and a new
 * plant joins a shard by its position alone. Unsharded (no flag, no env, or
 * `all`) runs every plant, exactly as before. Each shard still finishes with
 * its clean run(s), so every shard proves its own reds were its plants.
 * A tool opts in by resolving the shard itself (resolveShard) and passing it
 * to doorSelftest; doorSelftest's own default is every plant, so a stray
 * DOORPLANT_SHARD never cuts a corpus whose tool did not opt in.
 * tests/doorplant-shard.test.mjs pins the partition (union = all, no overlap)

/* ── THE HARNESS'S OWN DOOR ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   node tools/doorplant.mjs --selftest
 *
 * doorplant decides, for every `--selftest` corpus in the tree, whether a
 * known-bad was armed at all — and when it read plants wrong, the failure was
 * invisible in exactly the way this file exists to prevent. On a Windows
 * checkout 22 of startup-gate's 24 plants were CAUGHT and two printed PLANT
 * SITE DRIFTED; the two were the only two whose find-string spanned a line, so
 * against CRLF bytes nothing else COULD have matched. The corpus looked like it
 * was reporting on the source. It was reporting on the checkout.
 *
 * So the harness gets what it gives its callers. A SYNTHETIC CHECKOUT is built
 * on disk — files written deliberately in CRLF and deliberately in LF — and
 * `doorSelftest` runs WHOLE against it: the real copyTree, the real edit stage,
 * a real `node tools/<tool>` subprocess, the real verdicts. Nothing is handed
 * to planEdit directly; that would be the downstream-predicate defect the doors
 * audit named, one level up.
 *
 * Two corpora, because a fix that only buys a green is not a fix:
 *   GREEN — plants authored with \n, landing in CRLF files AND LF files, must
 *           every one be CAUGHT, and the unplanted fixture must run green.
 *   DRIFT — a find-string absent in EVERY line ending must still be the hard
 *           PLANT SITE DRIFTED. The EOL rule must not soften the hard-red.
 *
 * The fixture tool tests EOL UNIFORMITY FIRST and exits on it, so a plant that
 * matched but wrote its replacement back in the wrong ending arrives as
 * RED-FOR-WRONG-REASON rather than as a catch it did not earn.
 *
 * Cheap on purpose — no browser, no port, no bundle, about a second — so the
 * always-on lane can carry it next to `plantsites.mjs --check`.
 *
 * REMOVAL CONDITION: deleted with doorSelftest itself.
