// tools/tooltippersist.mjs — E8: the tooltip stays up until something replaces
// it, observed on the real combat screen through the finger's own door.
//
// HIS SENTENCE, and it is the whole spec (asks-ledger.md E8, his words):
//   "when selecting and holding on a card the tool tip pops up for a second and
//    then the zoom in card replaces it. instead keep the tooltip up after
//    holding the card for a set period of time and disappears once another card
//    is selected or it is played or another menu or game state activates"
//
// So the tooltip a COMPLETED HOLD summoned is persistent, and it ends on the
// three things he named. Every other tooltip — hover, focus cursor, the tap
// refusal — keeps today's behaviour exactly, and check 9 is the guard on that.
//
// WHAT IT CHECKS, per shape, in one continuous session on ?shot=combat:
//   1. HOLD: past the dial the copy is open AND the tooltip is still on screen.
//      This is his defect, stated positively — on dev the zoom card hid it.
//   2. LIFT: release the hold and the tooltip is STILL on screen. On touch the
//      lift fires pointerleave, which is what actually killed it; check 1 alone
//      is silence about the half a phone player lives in.
//   3. READABLE: the tooltip's box is wholly inside the viewport. A persistent
//      tooltip half off the screen is a worse artifact than a vanishing one.
//   4. INERT: computed pointer-events is `none`. THIS IS THE TRAP FLOOR — a
//      tooltip that stays cannot be allowed to eat a tap meant for the game.
//   5. HIS (a) another card is SELECTED  -> gone
//   6. HIS (b) a card is PLAYED          -> gone (discard moved, so it played)
//   7. HIS (c) a game state ACTIVATES    -> gone (End Turn)
//   8. REPLACED: hovering another control swaps the text, leaves exactly one
//      tooltip, and UNSTICKS it — the replacement is also the release valve.
//   9. UNCHANGED: an ordinary hover on the same card, with NO hold, still hides
//      on pointerleave. The change is the hold, not the tooltip.
//
// AND ONE MORE CELL, ON THE OTHER SCREEN THAT MOUNTS THIS SAME HAND — added
// 2026-08-17 by Bjorn gating this commit, because co-op was `unknown` here and
// `unknown` turned out to be a defect. ?shot=coop, 390x844:
//  10. COOP HOLD  — the hold sticks on the co-op hand too.
//  11. COOP LIFT  — and survives the release, same as solo.
//  12. COOP SELECTED — tapping another card ENDS it. THIS ONE WAS RED. coop.js
//      rebuilds its whole screen (`app.innerHTML = …`) instead of emptying
//      `.hand`, so the watch's host was DETACHED rather than mutated, the
//      callback never ran, and nothing on that surface could end the tooltip:
//      measured before the fix, "another card selected", END TURN and three
//      further taps all left it standing. coop.js carries zero hideTooltip()
//      calls, so unlike combat.js it has no second wire to fall back on.
//
// BOUNDARY — HIS THREE ENDINGS ARE CARRIED BY TWO DIFFERENT WIRES, AND THE
// SPLIT WAS MEASURED, NOT REASONED. I wrote "one mechanism" here first and P3
// disproved it in the same hour: cutting the DOM watch turned check 5 red and
// left 6 and 7 green.
//   · 5 SELECTED — carried ONLY by the new DOM watch in tooltip.js. No screen
//     calls hideTooltip() when a targetable card is merely selected; that wire
//     did not exist before this change and check 5 is the only thing on it.
//   · 6 PLAYED and 7 END TURN — carried by explicit hideTooltip() calls that
//     were ALREADY in combat.js (the drag start at :813, playCard, endTurn).
//     They would pass with the watch removed entirely. Their green is a claim
//     about the screen's existing wiring, not about this change.
// So a reader may not cite 6 and 7 as coverage of the new mechanism. Stated
// here rather than implied, per the predicate-vs-sentence rule.
//
// NOT MEASURED, and routed through the same watch as check 5: selecting by
// KEYBOARD (combat.js number keys) and selecting a targeted FLASK. Both
// re-render the hand, so both should end a stuck tooltip; neither is sampled
// here and both are `unknown`.
//
// CO-OP: NO LONGER UNKNOWN, AND NARROWER THAN IT LOOKS. Checks 10-12 boot
// ?shot=coop, so the hold, the lift and his ending (a) are measured on that
// surface. What is still NOT measured there: his (b) played and (c) end turn
// as co-op performs them (a network intent, not combat.js's local call), the
// wide shape, and every co-op scene that is not combat. `unknown`, not green.
//
// OTHER BOUNDARIES. Linux headless Chromium; synthesized touch is not a finger.
// Nothing here measures WHERE the tooltip sits beyond "inside the viewport" —
// place() is untouched by this change and this tool makes no claim about it.
// The hold path is measured on hand cards only, which is the only surface that
// can stick: no other caller asks for it.
