// tools/placement.mjs — ANCHORED PLACEMENT HAS ONE HOME, AND THE GAP HAS ONE
// HOME TOO. The check on src/ui/fx.js placeAnchored(), measured on the real
// screens through the real gestures.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. Until 2026-08-17 "put this element next to that one" was
// written out twice — tooltip.js place() and quicknav.js position() — with a
// private gap constant in each (`pad = 14`, `gap = 6`). Two homes for one length
// and two homes for one shape, so a placement fix had two files to land in and
// landed in neither. Sunna refused to collapse them twice and was right both
// times; the second of her reasons is the one this tool exists to keep honest:
// A SHARED PLACEMENT FUNCTION THAT HARD-CODES A GAP RE-COMMITS THE SECOND-COPY
// DEFECT AT THE MOMENT IT CLAIMS TO REMOVE ONE (Law 0 clause 4). The gap now
// lives in CSS as `--place-gap` on the placed element, and this tool measures
// the RENDERED distance against the DECLARED one. If the code ever grows its own
// copy again, the two disagree here and this goes red.
//
// WHAT IT CHECKS, per shape, on the real boot:
//   P1 DECLARED   every placed surface declares --place-gap, and it is > 0.
//                 A missing declaration resolves to 0 in placeAnchored (Law 0
//                 clause 5: fail visible, never plausible) — the panel welds
//                 itself to its anchor. That is a defect and this names it,
//                 rather than P2 passing because both sides agree on nothing.
//   P2 ONE HOME   the distance the browser actually rendered, on whichever axis
//                 separates the two boxes, equals the number the stylesheet
//                 declares. THIS IS THE LAW 0 CHECK. Tolerance 0.5 local px, and
//                 that is a float-noise tolerance, NOT a verdict threshold —
//                 see the neighbourhood note below.
//   P3 CLEAR      a tooltip does not sit on its anchor's SIBLINGS. `beside` was
//                 true and not enough: a hand card is one of five in a row, so
//                 "right of it" is on the next card. Measured before the fix, on
//                 ?shot=combat with a completed hold: 2 of 5 cards touched at
//                 390x844 (52.4% of one) and 3 of 5 at 1200x730, where the worst
//                 hold buried two at 96.2% and 71.0%.
//   P4 UNDER      the quick-nav panel's top is at or below its button's bottom,
//                 and its right edge is on the button's. That is the OTHER
//                 intent — `under`, not `beside` — and the reason the intent is
//                 named by the caller instead of guessed from the geometry.
//   P5 FLASK      the flask action menu opens under the SLOT THE PLAYER TAPPED,
//                 and its box touches none of the combat furniture a thumb aims
//                 at — the DRAW and DISCARD piles, END TURN, the hand cards, the
//                 sibling flask slots, the topbar buttons. Asserted twice: as it
//                 first opens, and again with Inspect expanded, because the
//                 description un-hides INSIDE the panel and placement is a
//                 one-shot. Before (b968e28, measured through this same door):
//                 1200x730 the menu (0,689)-(1200,730) — 567 local px below its
//                 own slot, DRAW and DISCARD 72.5% buried each; 390x844
//                 (0,897.8)-(433.3,937.8) — 726.9 px below its slot, piles 66.7%
//                 and 66.5%, the Inspect row's right 39% under the DRAW pile so
//                 a tap there opened the draw modal. THE COUNT IS ZERO, NOT A
//                 BUDGET: it is a count of touched controls, not a threshold.
//   P6 ON SCREEN  character creation's header menu opens under its ☰, right-
//                 aligned to it, AND INSIDE THE VIEWPORT — the claim none of
//                 P1-P5 makes, and the one the shipped defect broke. The menu
//                 open-coded its own placement and read the zoom off
//                 `document.documentElement`, which is the ONE element
//                 `body { zoom: var(--ui-zoom) }` does not touch, so it
//                 answered 1.00 at every UI size and visual px went straight
//                 into a local-px `style.left`. Measured before the fix,
//                 through this same door, in this file's local px: at
//                 1920x1080 (--ui-zoom 1.48) the menu's box was
//                 (1580.8,72.7)-(1800.8,304.7) in a 1297.3x729.7 room — its
//                 LEFT edge alone 283 px past the right one, so none of it was
//                 on the glass; at 390x844 (0.90) it was 37 px off its
//                 button's right edge and still on screen. The popover was
//                 OPEN the whole time and every category in it hit-testable. A
//                 menu drawn where nobody can see it reads to a player as a
//                 button that does nothing, which is how it was reported —
//                 which is also why NEITHER of the two placement claims the
//                 other intents make is enough on its own here.
//                 NOTE THE SHAPE DEPENDENCE: at exactly
//                 --ui-zoom 1.00 the old arithmetic is CORRECT, so 1200x730
//                 (which is 1.00) is blind to this whole class — see SHAPES
//                 below for why 1920x1080 joined it, and the corpus plant for
//                 the measurement at each of the three.
//
// THE DOOR, AND IT IS NARROWER THAN THIS HEADER CLAIMED UNTIL 2026-08-17. Every
// number is read off a real boot: served over http, loaded in headless Chromium,
// `getBoundingClientRect` converted to local px once (fx.js's rule) before
// anything is compared. The declared gap is read with
// `getComputedStyle(el).getPropertyValue(PLACE_GAP_PROP)` — the same call
// placeAnchored makes, off the same cascade, and the property NAME is read out
// of src/ui/fx.js rather than typed here (see PROP below). `--selftest` plants
// its known-bads as file bytes in a copied real tree (tools/doorplant.mjs) and
// runs this whole tool from the copy.
//
// WHAT THE GESTURE ACTUALLY IS. This header said "the real hover / the real
// click" and that was wider than its predicate (Bjorn, gating d705b66). The
// hover is `el.dispatchEvent(new PointerEvent('pointerenter'))` and the open is
// `button.click()` — SYNTHESIZED DOM EVENTS dispatched inside the page, not CDP
// `Input.dispatchMouseEvent`. Placement is computed from the element's own rect
// either way, so every geometry number below is sound. What this door CANNOT
// see is REACHABILITY: a control covered by another element, scrolled out of the
// hit-test, or behind a full-screen layer answers a dispatched pointerenter
// exactly as a reachable one does. A green P3 is a claim about where the tooltip
// LANDS, never about whether a thumb can summon it. Reachability has its own
// tools — actionreach.mjs, screenreach.mjs — and this one points at them rather
// than implying it covered them.
//
// THE NEIGHBOURHOOD, stated because the Gate asks (CHARTER 2b). P2's 0.5 is not
// a verdict threshold — it separates float noise from a real disagreement, and
// nothing about the design sits near it. It is still given a cell either side by
// the same door: plant A moves the stylesheet by ONE local px while the code
// keeps its own copy (measured 14, declared 15 → 1.0, red) and the clean run
// measures ~0.0 (green). One step of the check's own unit flips the verdict, and
// both cells arrive as a CSS edit in a copied tree. P1, P3, P4 and P5 are not
// thresholds at all: P1 is "declared or not", P3 and P5's collision half are
// counts that must be zero, P4 and P5's under half are sign tests. P5 adds no
// new number to this file — it reuses P2's tolerance through gapChecks.
//
// BOUNDARIES, and they are real.
//   · FOUR SURFACES, NOT EVERY PLACED THING — and this bullet said TWO until
//     2026-08-17, when the flask menu became placeAnchored's third caller, and
//     THREE until #1244 made character creation's header menu its fourth. The
//     tooltip, the quick-nav panel, the flask action menu and the creation
//     menu are its callers today; all four are measured here.
//   · P6 CANNOT SEE WHETHER ☰ CLOSES THE MENU, and that defect shipped. The
//     menu is opened with `.click()`, a synthesized activation with no
//     pointerdown/pointerup — so popover light dismiss never runs here. Until
//     #1244 the ☰ called `togglePopover()` from a click listener: light
//     dismiss shut the menu on pointerup and the click re-opened it, so with
//     real CDP input, mouse and touch alike, it read open/open/open/open and
//     could never be put away. Every P6 above was green on that build. The
//     fix is `popovertarget` (the browser owns the toggle); the receipt is a
//     hand measurement with real input, true/false/true/false after it —
//     a receipt, not coverage. Real input is actionreach's and
//     screenreach's door, not this one. tutorial.js still places its own bubble
//     in the veil's local space with its own clamp, and main.js's ?shot=fx points
//     are a third hand-rolled site. Neither is measured here and neither is
//     converted — `unknown`, named rather than implied.
//   · AND THE FLASK MENU HAS A MOUNT SITE THIS TOOL CANNOT REACH. flask.js is
//     mounted from combat.js, map.js and coop.js. `?shot=combat` is what P5
//     drives; the MAP surface is not in P5 — `unknown` for THIS tool.
//     THE `unknown` UNDER IT IS RESOLVED, 2026-08-17, AND THE ANSWER IS THE
//     OPPOSITE OF WHAT THE OLD WORDING IMPLIED. This line read "`?shot=map`
//     renders no `.mh-flask` at either shape" — true, and it reads as a missing
//     mount. It is a PRECONDITION: main.js seeds `run.flasks` only inside its
//     `combat || fx` shot branch, so `?shot=map` boots a FRESH run with zero
//     flasks and the mount correctly draws nothing. Reached the way a player
//     reaches it — `?shot=shop`, buy the shelf, LEAVE — the strip renders one
//     `.mh-flask` per flask and this menu opens under it at both shapes. That
//     surface is measured by tools/flaskbox.mjs, which uses that door and prints
//     it. A NAMED `unknown` ON AN EMPTY SCREEN IS STILL A GUESS ABOUT WHY IT IS
//     EMPTY, and this one was read as a missing feature for a night.
//     Co-op was measured by hand
//     (`?shot=coop`, last slot, both shapes: under, on screen, left-aligned) and
//     is not in P5, because a by-hand receipt is not coverage.
//   · P3 IS THE HAND AND NOTHING ELSE, AND THE REST IS NOW MEASURED ELSEWHERE.
//     Every other attachTooltip caller passes `clear: el.parentElement` too and
//     none is sampled HERE. It is no longer unknown: 160 tooltip-bearing controls
//     over EIGHT ?shot= surfaces (customize, combat, map, compendium, coop, shop,
//     profile, event) at both shapes, 8c34bc0 against d705b66, same synthesized
//     door as P3. 158 matched by key — 84 placements moved, 74 unchanged, ZERO
//     regressions (not one control where the sibling count or the worst sibling
//     coverage rose); worst coverage IMPROVED on 79 and went from >=99.9% to
//     exactly 0 on TWENTY-ONE, including the settings tab strip (`.set-tabs`,
//     5 siblings at 100% — a Law 3 surface), `.cp-grid` (96.3%), `.disc-faces`
//     (6 siblings at 100%), `.mh-actions` and `.coop-flasks`. The 2 unmatched
//     rows each side are the same hovered map node, whose own rect differs by
//     ~2 px under its hover scale. That sweep is a scratch probe, not a shipped
//     check: P3 stays the hand because the hand is where the corpus can plant,
//     and a one-off measurement is a receipt, not coverage.
//   · A RED P1 TAKES P2 WITH IT AND THE DENOMINATOR MOVES SILENTLY. gapChecks
//     returns after a P1 finding, so a run with an undeclared gap on ONE
//     surface prints one check fewer than the clean run, per shape. It cannot
//     hide a VERDICT — P1 is
//     already red and the exit is 1 — but "N check(s)" in the summary is not a
//     constant and must not be read as a coverage number.
//   · P3 IS VACUOUS ON A HAND OF ONE. It counts SIBLINGS touched; with a single
//     card there are none, so `0 sibling cards touched` is green about nothing.
//     Named rather than asserted — an unwatched floor is decoration, and no
//     plant in this corpus renders a short hand.
//   · THE FLASK ACTION MENU IS MEASURED SINCE 2026-08-17 — P5, and this bullet
//     used to say the opposite. It is a third placeAnchored caller now. Two
//     things P5 does NOT claim. (a) IT DOES NOT ASSERT THE ENEMY ROW. At 1200
//     the menu grazes the leftmost `.combatant` by 1.0% of its box; that is
//     reported, not asserted, because the menu and targeting are never on
//     screen together (choosing Use closes it before an enemy is aimed at) and
//     because any menu anchored to a HUD that sits above the field must land on
//     the field. Turning that graze into a number to stay under would be a
//     budget nobody derived. (b) IT DOES NOT EXERCISE THE HEIGHT CAP.
//     flask.js caps the panel at the room below the slot; with today's flask
//     texts the expanded panel is 156.9 local px against 761 of room at 390x844,
//     so the cap is computed and never binding here. Measured binding once, by
//     hand, with an injected 4000-character description — the panel stayed on
//     screen and scrolled inside itself — but that is a receipt, not coverage:
//     no plant in this corpus renders a long flask.
//   · LINUX HEADLESS CHROMIUM, three shapes. TEXT SIZE IS NOW MEASURED, UI SIZE IS
//     NOT. Law 4 clause 3 says the gap must not answer the Text-size dial;
//     measured at 1200x730 with ?shotSettings textSize S/M/L/XL, html font-size
//     9/10/11/12 px, the declared gap stays "14px" and the rendered separation
//     stays 14.01 local px at S, M and L. At XL the tooltip is tall enough that
//     the `left` candidate stops fitting and it flips to `above` — the GAP is
//     still 14, the SIDE is not the same, and no check watches the side at XL.
//     UI size is untouched: the gap is local px under `body { zoom }`, so it
//     scales with UI size by construction (Law 4 clause 2 wants exactly that),
//     which is an argument and not a measurement.
//   · P2 SAYS THE RENDERED GAP MATCHES THE DECLARED ONE. It says nothing about
//     whether 14 px is the right number for a human — that is Sunna's read.

// THE PROFILE IS THE LAUNCHER'S — tools/browser.mjs — AND THAT IS THE LANE THIS
// FILE'S OWN NOTES ASKED FOR TWICE. Both are Bjorn's, both kept in his words
// because they are the evidence the collapse was owed and the diagnosis I built
// against:
//
//   "THIS IS A PATCH, SAID OUT LOUD — the collapse is one shared launcher, not a
//    thirteenth copy of the removal" (gating d705b66), and then, after measuring
//    his own fix at 06b18f3:
//   "A FULL `--selftest` STILL LEAVES 3 PARTIAL PROFILES OF 6 INVOCATIONS —
//    3.3 MB where it was ~66 MB, and non-deterministic. Cause: `child.kill()`
//    signals the DIRECT child only, and Chromium's helper processes can outlive
//    it and re-create entries under the profile after rmSync has run. The honest
//    fix is a process-group kill (`detached: true` plus `process.kill(-pid)`) in
//    ONE SHARED LAUNCHER, which is the lane."
//
// That is exactly what the launcher does, and I reached the same mechanism from
// the other end before reading this: 9 of 10 concurrent runs clean, and the tenth
// left a profile holding a fresh `Default/` while `close()` reported success —
// an orphaned RENDERER recreating a tree whose absence had already been verified.
// Group kill, real join with no short ceiling, and a re-check after a settle:
// 36/36 at 12-way concurrency.
//
// HIS SECOND NAMED REMAINDER CLOSES TOO, AND IT IS NOT A SEPARATE LANE. He wrote
// that Chromium "also makes a `.org.chromium.Chromium.<rand>` scratch dir directly
// in $TMPDIR, OUTSIDE --user-data-dir, which nothing here can reach." It is
// reachable: the launcher points the child's TMPDIR INSIDE the profile, so that
// scratch dir lands where the profile's removal takes it. Measured three ways in
// browser.mjs's header, and watched as a plant either side of the pin (P7).
