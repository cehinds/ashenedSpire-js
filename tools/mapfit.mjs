// tools/mapfit.mjs — when the game frames the act map for the player, is the
// player's next step ON SCREEN?
//
// THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR. Bjorn, at 390x844: 9 of 12 seeds hide at least one
// of the player's next-step options; on one seed all four are hidden; 0 of 12 at
// 1200x730. The centroid `centerOnCurrent()` framed was CORRECT — the canvas was
// 834 px against a 390 viewport and nothing fitted the framing to the content.
// The reachable nodes are the only decision on that screen. Not a hard map; a
// hidden choice.
//
// WHY IT IS NOT tools/mapreach.mjs. That sweep asks whether a node a player can
// SEE can be PRESSED — it hit-tests against the chrome, at four dimensions of
// coincidence, and it is right to. This one asks the question one step earlier:
// is the node in the viewport at all, after the game has finished framing. A map
// whose choices are all off screen passes mapreach perfectly, because nothing is
// covering them.
//
// THE SECOND CHECK IS THE ONE THAT CLOSES THE CLASS. `centerOnCurrent()` has
// never been able to report failure: `Math.max(0, …)` clamped the low end,
// NOTHING clamped the high end, and the browser clamped it silently — asked for
// scrollTop 263, it got 1, on 39 of 39 nodes. So the screen now publishes what
// it did (`.map-scroll[data-framing]` = `fit` | `clipped`, with the overflow in
// local px), and this tool checks THE PAGE'S OWN REPORT AGAINST WHAT IT
// MEASURES. A camera that cannot miss cannot be trusted when it says it didn't;
// a camera whose confession disagrees with the photograph is worse than one that
// stays quiet, and that disagreement is a finding here in its own right.
//
// AND THE MAP HAS THIRTEEN SCREENS, NOT ONE. Every map measurement this repo has
// taken was taken at the entrance row, because `?shot=map` is the only map
// position anything could open. `?shotAt=floor:N` (src/main.js, dev-only, same
// shape as `?shotEvent`) is what lets this sweep stand mid-climb, where the
// framing is a fan-out from one node rather than the spread of the doors — a
// different problem that had never been looked at.
//
// Usage
//   node tools/mapfit.mjs                      source tree via tools/serve.mjs
//   node tools/mapfit.mjs --dist               dist/AshenSpire.html (file://; http if pack-shaped — browser.mjs buildPageUrl)
//   node tools/mapfit.mjs --only 390x844
//   node tools/mapfit.mjs --seeds BJORN1,BJORN2  --floors 1,4,7,10
//   node tools/mapfit.mjs --quick              one shape, three seeds, entrance only
//   node tools/mapfit.mjs --mutate             REINSTATE the defect; must go red
//   node tools/mapfit.mjs --zoom Fit           sweep the COMPUTED frame
//   node tools/mapfit.mjs --zoom 115           sweep one percentage
//   CHROME=/path/to/chrome node tools/mapfit.mjs
//
// WITH NO --zoom THIS SWEEPS WHAT SHIPS, which since #107 is a percentage: Sunna
// held the computed frame as the default because, arriving without the fog and
// parchment that make a close frame read as intended, it reads as a map that has
// been cropped. So the default row of this table is the game as played, and the
// `Fit` row is what the player gets if they choose it. Both are worth a number
// and they are not the same number — reporting only one would have been the
// second copy of the mistake this tool was written to catch.
//
// OBSERVED RED, AND THE TWO HALVES NEEDED DIFFERENT KNOWN-BADS.
//
//   the hidden-step half   needs no mutation at all. It is red on the shipped
//     tree right now, at the entrance row, and it is red for a real reason: six
//     walkers land on up to `columns` distinct doors, so the entrance frame
//     spans 5.92 columns on average (300 seeds) and wants 0.72x at its widest,
//     against a ladder that floors at 1x. No camera fixes that; `entries` does.
//   the disagreement half   is green everywhere, which is the good news and
//     makes it UNKNOWN rather than proven. `--mutate` is for that half only: it
//     falsifies the screen's own confession — writes `data-framing="fit"` onto a
//     frame this tool can see is clipped — and the run must report it. A tool
//     that cross-checks a report it has never seen wrong is a tool taking the
//     report's word for it.
//
// The first draft of --mutate pinned Map zoom to 115%, the frame the computed
// one replaced, and came back GREEN on all twelve mid-climb cells. That is not a
// broken mutation; it is the finding, and it is why this act is shaped the way
// it is: mid-climb framing was never the defect. The entrance row was.
//
// Exit codes
//   0  every framing node is wholly on screen at every mobile cell swept, and
//      the page's own report agrees with the measurement everywhere
//   1  a hidden next step, or the camera's report disagrees with the photograph
//   2  usage / no browser / a screen that would not mount / nothing swept /
//      --mutate not caught — never a pass
//
// BOUNDARY, and it is not small: headless Chromium on one Linux machine, two
// shapes, N seeds, the positions named on the command line. It measures
// GEOMETRY AFTER THE FRAME SETTLES — not whether a thumb can reach the node
// (mapreach), not whether the act is fun to climb (Sunna), and not one frame of
// the animation before the ResizeObserver fires.
