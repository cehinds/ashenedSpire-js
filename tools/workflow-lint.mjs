// tools/workflow-lint.mjs — THE DOOR CANNOT SEE THE WIRING ABOVE ITSELF.
//
// tools/verdict.mjs makes a tool's silence audible, but it only speaks when the
// step RUNS. A step with no command, or a step whose command was overwritten by
// a duplicate YAML key, never reaches the door at all — it is silence one level
// up, and it is invisible to every check inside the process.
//
// THIS IS NOT HYPOTHETICAL. The first cut of the PR that added the door shipped
// exactly that defect: `- name: Engine suite` with NO `run:`, and the following
// step carrying TWO `run:` keys. The suite would have silently not run, or the
// door's own self-test would have been overwritten. Two reviewers caught it on
// the pushed head; my local YAML check passed it, because `yaml.safe_load`
// resolves duplicate keys last-wins WITHOUT COMPLAINING — my validation was
// itself a silent green, which is the card's defect class a third time.
//
// So this reads the workflow AS TEXT, where the duplicate is visible, rather
// than through a parser that has already thrown the evidence away.
//
// Usage
//   node tools/workflow-lint.mjs                 lint .github/workflows/*.yml
//   node tools/workflow-lint.mjs --selftest      the known-bads, each a file
//
// Exit codes
//   0  every step in every workflow carries exactly one command
//   1  a finding (named, with file and line)
//   2  usage / nothing to lint — never a pass
