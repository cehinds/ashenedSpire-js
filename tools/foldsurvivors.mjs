// tools/foldsurvivors.mjs — E5's class, and the reason no existing gate could
// see it.
//
// THE DEFECT. `mountDisclosure` sets `host.innerHTML` (disclosure.js). Every
// row already in that host is DESTROYED. A row survives only because the
// roster handed to the mount holds its box BY REFERENCE and the mount re-adopts
// it. STARTING ARMOUR and STAT POINTS are deliberately not in customize's
// SECTIONS, so nothing held them: two rows the template writes were absent from
// the document from 9676d9a to aefc356, on a screen every gate called green.
//
// WHY EVERY GATE CALLED IT GREEN, AND THIS IS THE POINT OF THE FILE.
// `disclosure.js:280` writes `button.dataset.face = entry.key`, one-to-one with
// the roster it was handed. SO `data-face` IS THE DECLARATION. A gate that
// compares a declared roster against the document is comparing the declaration
// to a COPY OF ITSELF: at aefc356 and at the fix, `.cz-fields` reports the same
// six faces. creationbrief.mjs printed 6/6 and exited 0 HONESTLY — it was not
// lazy, it was structurally incapable, because THE ROSTER NEVER NAMED THE ROWS
// THAT VANISHED. The fix for a blind gate is not a stricter gate.
//
// SO THIS TOOL DOES NOT READ A ROSTER. It watches the WIPE.
// A MutationObserver installed at document-start records, per fold host, every
// element removed from it and every element put back. A row removed and never
// restored is the evidence the mount destroyed something — evidence that exists
// nowhere in the after-state, which is exactly why the after-state was green.
//
// AND THE HARD HALF — THE DISCRIMINATOR, WHICH IS A FINDING BEFORE IT IS CODE.
// "Removed and not restored" is NOT the defect on its own. Measured on dev:
//
//   .cz-fields   roster 6   ->  [FOLD] + STARTING ARMOUR + STAT POINTS   MUST survive
//   .shop-bars   roster 4   ->  [FOLD] only, #shop-sell gone entirely    MUST NOT survive
//
// ONE CONSTRUCTION — a row in the template that the roster does not hold —
// MEANING OPPOSITE THINGS, with NOTHING in either screen marking which reading
// applies. `...(sellOn() ? [{ key: 'bar:sell', ... }] : [])` is the ruled-intent
// deletion: his toggle off means ABSENT, never greyed. Re-appending it the way
// customize re-appends its two would RESURRECT a feature he ruled away.
//
// No screen publishes its conditionality. It is only observable BY MOVING THE
// INPUT. So the classification is derived from TWO BOOTS of the same screen:
//
//   roster membership NEVER moves + never restored  -> UNCONDITIONAL. Red (E5).
//   roster membership MOVES with the input          -> CONDITIONAL. Absent when
//                                                      out of roster is CORRECT.
//
// THE COST IS A SECOND BOOT, NOT AN ANNOTATION, and whoever maintains this is
// owed that sentence plainly. The price of having no second roster is running
// the screen twice. The roster is read off the DOM and never typed here; the
// condition is supplied as an INPUT (?shotSettings=) and never restated as
// logic. One home for the truth, read twice — not two homes. If that cost is
// ever too high for some surface, that is a product conversation, not a licence
// to reintroduce a hand-written list.
//
// IDENTITY IS STRUCTURAL, NOT A SENTENCE. A row is named by the id of the box
// it owns (`cz-armours`, `cz-statedit`, `shop-sell`), never by its label text —
// a label is copy and copy rots, and an anchor that rots reports PLANT SITE
// DRIFTED instead of the finding.

// `disclosure.js:162` wipes the host, `:189` re-parents each adopted box into
// the panel, and BOTH run before the observer callback fires. By the time the
// callback inspects a removed wrapper, its box has already been moved out of
// it, so six distinct picker rows all read as one anonymous `.div` and the tool
// reported an orphan that does not exist. The evidence has to be taken
// SYNCHRONOUSLY, at the instant of destruction, or it is evidence about a
// different DOM than the one that was destroyed.
//
// So this wraps the one operation that does the destroying and records what was
// in the host at that instant. It reads; it changes nothing.
//
// IDENTITY IS THE BOX, NOT ITS WRAPPER. `.cz-fields` rows are anonymous divs
// wrapping a labelled box (`#cz-classes`, `#cz-armours`). The wrapper is
// presentation chrome and is MEANT to die when its box is adopted; the box is
// the thing that must survive. So a row is named by the ids it contains.
