// tools/onevocab.mjs — Sten, 2026-08-15.
//
// ONE QUESTION: is the relic-modifier vocabulary ONE vocabulary, or two?
//
// Codex's #178 gave relics the power to grant a resource. A relic now says
//
//     passives: { modifiers: [{ tag: 'resource.flat', resource: 'hp', amount: 2 }] }
//
// and that sentence has to mean the same thing everywhere, forever, or one of
// its spellings quietly stops being read. Law 0 clause 4 — one home per fact —
// with a long fuse: two spellings for one concept do not fail on the day they
// are born. They fail the day somebody edits one of them.
//
// THE SEAM THIS FILLS, and it was named for me before I got here.
// tools/closedsets.mjs (Viki, 2026-08-08) asks whether an exported closed set
// has a READER. Its own boundary says what it cannot ask:
//
//     "it cannot see whether a SECOND, hand-typed copy of a set exists
//      somewhere. Green here means 'every closed set is read by something',
//      never 'no set is duplicated'. Finding the duplicate is still a
//      person's job."
//
// tests/run-node.mjs prints the same hole in its own boundary (cases 52–53:
// "silent on whether a set has a second, hand-typed copy somewhere — the defect
// that made the question worth asking"). This is that person's job, made a
// machine's, for exactly one vocabulary: the one a relic uses to modify you.
//
// THE TWO FACTS IT GUARDS. Both derived from the tree at run time; neither is
// typed in this file, because a sentinel that re-types the vocabulary it
// watches IS the defect it is watching for.
//
//   FACT 1 — WHICH TAGS EXIST.   Authority: RELIC_MODIFIER_TAGS (schemas.js).
//   FACT 2 — WHICH RESOURCES A RELIC MAY NAME. Authority: the derived-stat rule
//            rows, because derivedStats.js `resolveSnapshotNumbers` folds a
//            relic bonus INTO `rules[resource].base` / `.gainPerTier` and
//            throws on a resource with no row. What the fold accepts is what
//            the word means; every other list of resource ids is a copy of it.
//
// SEVEN CHECKS. A1/A2 read the tree's bytes; A3–A6 and ONEANSWER drive the
// production doors.
//
//   A1  no second TYPED home for the tag set — no file outside the declaration
//       may carry two or more tags in one list literal.
//   A2  every ENGINE tag-dispatch site handles EVERY tag — a src/ site that
//       branches on two of three has a silent hole, and the third falls through
//       an `else`. Scoped to src/ minus src/content/: a tool asking a narrow
//       question may read a subset and a content row merely carries a tag, but
//       neither may re-type the set (that is A1's job).
//   A3  the two production doors accept exactly the declared tags, and agree
//       with each other tag for tag.
//   A4  the relic resource set is a subset of what the fold can accept.
//   A5  the two production doors accept exactly the same resource ids — this is
//       the check that goes red the day one door learns a word the other
//       does not.
//   A6  ONE DERIVATION PATH: a relic's resource grant is entirely mediated by
//       the derived-stat snapshot, and the max-HP addend list stays closed —
//       (a) pinned BY NAME against the three source homes AND by value at the
//       door, because a list can change without a number moving.
//   ONEANSWER  every door that re-derives max HP returns the same number.
//       Called A7 until 2026-08-15; renamed because that name already belonged
//       to another artifact (see its own comment block). It exists because a
//       plant got away from A6 — also its own comment. The
//       composition `derived + equipment + ledger` has THREE homes today, and
//       a drift in the one that runs first is invisible to anything that only
//       reads a freshly created run.
//
// THE DOORS, stated because an observation that cannot name its entry point has
// not made the claim (the instrument rule's same-door clause):
//   census (A1, A2)  — FILE BYTES under src/, tools/, tests/, comments blanked.
//   pin (A6(a))      — FILE BYTES of the three files that compose max HP. This
//                      half reads TERMS, so its door is the source, not a run.
//   probes (A3–A6,   — the real content bundle -> validateContent ->
//    ONEANSWER)          createRegistries -> createRunState, and for ONEANSWER also
//                      createSaveManager.loadRun. Nothing is handed to an inner
//                      function directly; a planted row travels the whole road a
//                      shipped row travels.
//   --selftest       — tools/doorplant.mjs: each known-bad is written into a
//                      COPY OF THE REAL TREE and this tool is run whole from
//                      that copy.
//
// Run:  node tools/onevocab.mjs             the tree — exit 1 on findings
//       node tools/onevocab.mjs --selftest  the corpus — exit 1 if a plant lives
// Exit 2 = the check had nothing to rule on (SOP 2's ⚙ clause).
//
// REMOVAL CONDITION (SOP 1's corollary): deleted the day relic modifiers stop
// being a separate vocabulary — when a relic states a resource grant in the
// same words a piece of equipment does, through one registry, this file has no
// two things to compare and is decoration. It is NOT removed for being red.

// Everything else here is derived from the tree, because a sentinel that

// deliberate exception, and the reason is the finding itself: the max-HP addend
// list HAS NO DECLARED HOME to derive it from. Three files compose
// `derived + equipment + ledger` in three different spellings and no module
// exports the list, so the only place it can be pinned is here — where an edit
// to run creation must come and change it, in review, by hand.
//
// WHY BY NAME AND NOT BY NUMBER (Marina's condition, 2026-08-16, and she was
// right about the disease and generous about its severity). A6(a) used to be a
// VALUE identity: maxHp === derived + equipment + ledger, recomputed from the
// same three terms. That assertion cannot see a change to the LIST when the
// SUM does not move, and both ways in happen for free:
//   · a FOURTH addend guarded to zero — `+ (run.relicHpFlat || 0)` — the shape
//     a real one arrives in, reader wired this week and writer next week;
//   · a term SWAPPED for a second spelling of itself — `run.maxHpAdjustment`
//     read into `hpLedger` and the ledger term rewritten to `hpLedger`.
// Both were planted through doorplant into a copy of the real tree on
// 2026-08-16 and both were NOT CAUGHT, exit 0, the whole tool green — while
// this check's own comment said "three terms decide max HP and no more". The
// comment was making a claim the assertion never checked. That is the same
// agreement-is-not-synchronization shape I collapsed in conhp.mjs, committed by
// me, in the check I wrote to catch it.
//
// So the names are asserted at the source and the arithmetic is asserted at the
// door, and A6(a) is BOTH. Names catch a list that changed while the numbers
// held; numbers catch a value that changed while the names held. Either alone
// is half a check.
//
// BY NAME, AND BY MULTISET — the second hole, one level down (Vira, 2026-08-15).
// The name half above was written as a SET comparison, and a set cannot see a
// term written twice: `+ run.maxHpAdjustment + run.maxHpAdjustment` is four
// addends and three names, nothing added, nothing gone, exit 0, whole tool
// green. It was NOT CAUGHT, planted through doorplant, and it is in the corpus
// below. The value half could not cover for it, and the reason is the whole
// point: `maxHpAdjustment` measures 0 on all three classes at birth, so a
// DUPLICATED ZERO MOVES NO TOTAL. The two halves were blind in the same place at
// once — one defect, not two — and a double-count of that exact term is the
// historical defect this seam was built around. Occurrences are now counted.
//
// `addends` is the exact top-level `+`-separated text inside `Math.max(1, ...)`,
// whitespace-normalized. It is verbatim on purpose: a spelling change IS the
// thing being watched, so a lenient match would be the hole again.
//
// WHERE THIS PIN WILL LIE, said before it does. Comparison is by SET, so
// reordering the three terms passes — reorder is not a defect. But bracketing
// them differently (`a + (b + c)`) reads as two top-level terms and goes red
// with nothing wrong, and so does renaming a local that holds a term. Both are
// TRUE reds by this pin's own question — the written list changed — and both
// are fixed the same way: read the diff, then edit the pin. A pin whose whole
// job is to force a human edit cannot also promise never to ask for one.
