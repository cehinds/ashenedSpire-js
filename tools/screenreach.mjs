// tools/screenreach.mjs — is every control on every screen reachable by a
// finger, at the shapes we claim to support?
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS, and it is not a hypothetical. tools/mobilefit.mjs measures
// the combat board in detail and says nothing about the rest of the game. The
// portrait work (EldenSpire#23) changes --ui-zoom for EVERY screen — from 0.62
// to ~0.90 on a phone, which is less local space, not more — while only combat
// gets a narrow layout. Combat came out at 45/45 and I would have shipped it,
// and this sweep found three controls that were reachable on dev at 390x844
// and were NOT on my branch:
//
//   COVERED  ⚒ (#combat-armoury)  <- div.pile.draw   my repositioned piles
//   COVERED  a map node           <- button.zbtn     the map's floating zoom stack (x2)
//
// Fixing a lockout in the fight and putting a different one in the top bar is
// not a fix. Both are fixed; this is the check that has to stay.
//
// WHAT IT DOES. Boots each ?shot= state at each shape, collects everything a
// player can press, and hit-tests the centre of each with elementFromPoint.
//
// THE ONE DISTINCTION THAT MAKES THE NUMBER MEAN ANYTHING — and the first two
// versions of this file got it wrong in opposite directions. A control that
// fails the hit-test is either:
//   - SCROLLED OUT: its centre is outside its scroll ancestor's visible box.
//     The player reaches it by scrolling. Not a defect. The act map is a
//     pannable canvas with 60+ nodes and most of them are off-screen at any
//     moment; counting those called the map 23-unreachable and the desktop
//     4-unreachable, all of it noise.
//   - COVERED: its centre IS inside the scrollport and something else answers
//     the hit-test. That is EldenSpire#21's mechanism, wherever it appears.
// Only COVERED is counted. Getting this wrong in the loud direction buries the
// real finding in false positives; getting it wrong in the quiet direction
// reports zero forever.
//
// Usage
//   node tools/screenreach.mjs                    source tree via tools/serve.mjs
//   node tools/screenreach.mjs --dist             dist/AshenSpire.html (file://; http if pack-shaped — browser.mjs buildPageUrl)
//   node tools/screenreach.mjs --only 390x844
//   CHROME=/path/to/chrome node tools/screenreach.mjs
//
// Exit codes
//   0  no control is covered at any shape
//   1  a covered control  (the known-bad: this branch before the two fixes)
//   2  usage / no browser / a screen that would not mount — never a pass
//
// BOUNDARY, printed again at the end: Linux headless Chromium only, and CDP
// emulation is not a phone. It reaches only the screens that have a ?shot=
// state — title, map, combat, boss, death. CUSTOMIZE, SHOP, REST, REWARDS and
// the overlays have no ?shot= and are NOT covered by this or anything else,
// which matters because #23's own bleed evidence came from customize. It
// hit-tests reachability at rest; it does not press anything, does not judge
// legibility, and cannot see a control that only appears mid-interaction.

// DOOR, and why --selftest exists (Rune, 2026-08-15). The real input is the

// right door and always was. What it lacked was a re-runnable known-bad: its
// only observation was "this branch before the two fixes" — a ref nobody can
// check out now, which under SOP 2's drift clause is `unknown`, not coverage.
// Vira's audit (2026-08-14) rated it OBSERVED-ONCE for exactly that.
