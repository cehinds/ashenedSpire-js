// tools/sfx-gain-probe.mjs — headless gain-target inspection for the SFX
// recipes (#46). Proves the tuning path Constantine was promised: the value a
// recipe carries in src/content/sfx.js is the value the engine schedules on a
// live gain node — no copy, no clamp, no code in between (Law 1 clause 3).
//
// How: stub just enough WebAudio for initAudio() to run under Node, play each
// recipe id through the real engine, record every value scheduled on a gain
// param, and check each layer's peak (or its default) appears among them.
// Nothing here has ears — this is reachability of the number, not quality of
// the sound.
//
// Usage:   node tools/sfx-gain-probe.mjs             # probe all recipes
//          node tools/sfx-gain-probe.mjs --selftest  # known-bad: prove the
//            probe goes red when a table value and the engine disagree (the
//            instrument rule: a check nobody has watched fail is not green).
//
// THE DOORS, FOUR OF THEM, AND TWO ARE DOWNSTREAM ON PURPOSE. Vira's doors
// audit (2026-08-14) called this probe "DOWNSTREAM by declared choice, honestly
// scoped": classes 1 and 2 below enter at the COMPARATOR — the expectation and
// the measured pool — never at the recipe. For the defect they were written
// against that is the right door, because the defect WAS in the comparator
// (the `includes` alibi, her #46 finding). But her sentence continued: "the
// recipe-drop class has no plant." She was right, and class 3 is that plant.
//
//   class 1  false expectation   in-process; `want` is set to a known-false
//                                value. Door: the comparator.
//   class 2  dropped duplicate   in-process; one occurrence removed from the
//                                measured pool. Door: the comparator.
//   class 3  A CLAMP IN THE ENGINE   the real door. A disposable copy of this
//                                tree gets ONE REAL EDIT to src/ui/audio.js —
//                                a clamp between the recipe's number and the
//                                gain node — and THIS PROBE IS RE-RUN INSIDE
//                                THE COPY, so its own `../src/ui/audio.js`
//                                import resolves to the planted engine. Every
//                                stage the real probe performs runs.
//                                This is the class the header's own claim is
//                                about — "no copy, no clamp, no code in
//                                between" — and until now nothing had ever
//                                watched it fail.
//   class 4  delayed procedural cue   a disposable copy moves synth scheduling
//                                to a timer while the optional sample stalls.
//                                Door: the triggering event. Every empty gain
//                                pool must go red, never pass as a quiet recipe.
//
// Exit 0 = every recipe's peaks reached the gain nodes; 1 = any miss.
// REMOVAL CONDITION: delete this probe when the synth SFX layer is removed in
// favour of samples (#46's own removal condition) — a sample's gain is the
// file's, and there is no recipe table left to inspect.
