// tools/release-shots.mjs — photograph the RELEASE BUILD, screen by screen,
// at the two shapes Constantine looks at (Bjorn, 2026-08-07, Track C).
//
// ── A SENTENCE OF MINE THAT WAS FALSE FOR EIGHT DAYS ────────────────────────
// (Bjorn, 2026-08-16, gating Sten's version work at 51f3703.)
//
// Line 8 below used to end: "What Constantine runs is the single-file bundle; a
// shot of the source tree is evidence about a thing he never opens." IT IS THE
// OTHER WAY ROUND ON THE PATH README CALLS RECOMMENDED, and I never checked it.
//
//   run.sh -> tools/launch.mjs: builds build/AshenSpire.html, copies it into
//   dist/, and then calls serve({ root: ROOT }) — WHICH SERVES THE SOURCE TREE.
//   Measured at 51f3703: `GET /` returns 499 bytes, byte-for-byte index.html;
//   build/AshenSpire.html is 3,056,062 bytes. He is handed the source. dist/ is
//   built by that command and then not opened by it.
//
// SO THERE ARE TWO REAL PATHS, and README.md offers both: "One-click
// (recommended)" -> run.sh -> THE SOURCE; "Standalone file" -> dist/
// AshenSpire.html -> THE BUNDLE. Naming one of them "what Constantine runs"
// was a claim wider than anything anyone had watched.
//
// THIS TOOL IS NOT WITHDRAWN AND ITS SHOTS ARE NOT VOID. Its door is
// dist/AshenSpire.html and it photographs that correctly; what was wrong was the
// SENTENCE laid over the door — Vira's predicate-versus-sentence finding
// (development.md, *the door named is the extent of the green*) applied one
// level up, to a tool's premise instead of a check's predicate. Narrowed here
// rather than quietly deleted: every dist/ green in this repo is evidence about
// the standalone-file path, and is SILENT about the recommended one. The source
// path has its own eye — tools/screenshot.mjs and tools/buildstamp-shot.mjs,
// both of which serve src/ — and neither is a substitute for the other.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHY IT IS NOT tools/screenshot.mjs. That tool serves the
// SOURCE TREE and captures the ?shot= states that existed when it was written.
// Two gaps make it the wrong instrument for a RELEASE ARTIFACT:
//   1. It photographs src/, not dist/AshenSpire.html — so it is silent about the
//      file README hands a player under "Standalone file", which is the thing a
//      release IS. (It is NOT silent about what run.sh opens; see above.)
//   2. Five player-facing surfaces have NO ?shot= state and therefore cannot
//      appear in it at all — the Armoury, the menu tabs, Settings,
//      Title → Profile, and the profile crisis notice (#66/#67, the newest
//      surface in the release). A capture set that silently omits the newest
//      screens is a green that means nothing.
// So this drives the built artifact over CDP: ?shot= where one exists, real
// clicks where one does not, and a seeded localStorage for the crisis notice —
// which is exactly the precondition a player with unreadable bytes has.
//
// KNOWN-BAD: tools/release-shots-selftest.mjs (Bjorn, 2026-08-15). Every
// refusal below — unaccounted state, blind reader, partial blindness, an empty
// home, a stale bundle — and the landmark MISS have each been OBSERVED red at
// dev = 5244543, planted as real edits to a copy of the whole repo and run
// through this file as a whole program. Before that they were `unknown`, not
// green, whatever this tool printed (development.md, *The instrument rule*).
//   node tools/release-shots-selftest.mjs
//
// THE ARTIFACT IS NEVER MODIFIED. The crisis states are reached by writing
// storage from outside and reloading, never by injecting script into the HTML.
// A shot of a patched bundle is a shot of something we do not ship.
//
// Usage:  node tools/release-shots.mjs [--out DIR] [--only SHOT] [--shape TAG]
// Exit 0 = every shot captured and its screen asserted present; 1 = any miss.
//
// BOUNDARY: this proves a screen RENDERED and that its landmark element is on
// it. It does not prove the screen is legible (Sunna), correct (Vira), or that
// the art reads (Freja). Two viewports only — 390x844 and 1200x730.
//
// TWO DENOMINATORS (Bjorn, 2026-08-07, Marina's ruling). Coverage used to be
// counted against ONE list — the ?shot= states in src/main.js — which is the
// set of TOP-LEVEL screens. A player also navigates INSIDE a state: six overlay
// tabs, six settings categories, three armoury views. None of those has a
// ?shot= state, so the old gate printed `0 unaccounted` while fifteen surfaces
// went unphotographed. It proved the two lists agreed and was silent on whether
// the surviving list was every surface — a check that could not fail.
// So: denominator 1 = top-level states (unchanged), denominator 2 = navigable
// sub-surfaces, DERIVED from the homes that actually define them. Both print,
// each with what was and was not photographed.

    //   // the strip.
    //
    // The reasoning was right and the door is shut. `?shotSettings` writes the
    // category into the live profile at boot (src/main.js, beside pickStorage)
    // — and THEN this state calls `saves.startNewProfile()`, in main.js's
    // `shotState === 'profile'` branch (src/main.js:2052 at cc5f6dd — this line
    // first said 2044, which is a COMMENT line eight above the call: cite the
    // symbol, and read the number as a convenience that rots),
    // which is `replacePrimaryWith(freshMeta(), …)`, and `freshMeta()` is
    // `{ settings: {} }` (src/engine/save.js:274). The act that CREATES the
    // archive this shot exists to photograph is the act that throws the
    // category we asked for into the drawer with the outgoing profile. By the
    // time showSettings() reads `settings.settingsCategory` there is nothing
    // there, so `current = cats[0]` = Display, and `.prof-restore` — which is
    // rendered only inside the Profile panel — is not on the page at all.
    //
    // MEASURED, both edges, at 334fd02 on dist/AshenSpire.html:
    //   ?shot=profile asked for Profile/About/Audio/Advanced -> tab was
    //     Display every time, .prof-restore = 0 every time.
    //   ?shot=title (same door, no profile swap) asked for About/Audio/Profile

    //   ?shot=profile, Profile tab clicked by hand -> 1 .prof-entry,
    //     1 .prof-restore.
    // The one difference between the two states is the profile swap.

    // NOT AN APP DEFECT. A new profile having default settings is the correct
    // behaviour; what was false was this tool's assumption that a display
    // setting survives a state whose whole job is to replace the profile
    // holding it. So the harness follows the surface, and CLICKS —
    // which is what SUB_SURFACE_GROUPS' `settings` reach has always done
    // ("#90: the categories are a TAB STRIP now … the drive CLICKS instead of
    // scrolling"). That was the second copy: one fact — how you open a settings
    // category — written twice, and only one of them worked. The query

// DENOMINATOR 2 — the navigable sub-surfaces, and THE FINDING.
//
// THERE IS NO SINGLE HOME THAT DEFINES THE TAB LIST. I looked for one and it
// does not exist. What exists is three homes in three different layers:
//
//   overlay tabs      src/ui/uiContent.js       MENU_TABS      (a UI content table)
//   settings sections src/ui/screens/settings.js settingsCategories() (derived from the rows)
//   armoury views     src/content/balance.js     balance.equipment.views (game data)
//
// Each of those IS a single home for its own set — the overlay strip and the
// quick-nav dropdown already derive from MENU_TABS, which is the shape we want.
// What has no home is the set OF SETS. So this tool cannot ask the tree "what
// tabbed surfaces exist"; it can only ask "what is in the three I was told
// about." A fourth surface added tomorrow in a fourth place is invisible here,
// and no amount of care in this file fixes that — the fix is upstream and is
// stated in the report and in the BOUNDARY block at the end of this run.
//
// What I did NOT do, deliberately: hand-list the tabs here. A list of tabs in
// the harness is a second home for the fact, which is the exact defect this
// tool exists to catch, wearing my own hat. Below, each group names its home
// and reads it; the ids are never retyped.
//
// `reach(id)` is a RECIPE FOR ANY MEMBER of the set, never a per-id table: it
// is written once per group and knows nothing about which ids exist. That is
// what makes the derivation load-bearing — add a row to MENU_TABS and it gets
// photographed and asserted on the next run with no edit here.

// rule in ui.css: 58 shots, every assertion true, exit 0. I reproduced it in my
// own tree before touching this file. `kanban` renders HYBRID'S DOM (draw() is
// `if (view === 'grid') … else …`, so every unknown id lands in the else) under
// NEITHER view's CSS — a fourth alignment no rule in the tree authors. Six of my

// Green today pairwise, red on kanban — measured, not reasoned.
//
// I add a second, INDEPENDENT detector for the armoury, because the two halves
// of what she measured live in two different homes: the DOM comes from
// equipment.js, the alignment from styles/ui.css. That second decider is GONE
// as of #88 — the stylesheet keys off characteristics written off the row — so
// the check that guarded it is gone too, and the note is kept to say why.
//
// What neither of these is: a check that the view is CORRECT. Two distinct,
// authored layouts can both be wrong. Consistency, not correctness — mine, said

// Marina's ruling on my own best find, pointed at the browser: EVIDENCE MUST
// COME FROM ONE ARTIFACT, NEVER TWO ASSUMED EQUAL. This tool used to spawn
// chromium on a FIXED port 9431 and then `fetch('127.0.0.1:9431/json/list')` and
// attach to whatever answered. Two failures, and they compound:
//
//   1. NOTHING EVER KILLED THE CHILD — no `child.kill()` on any path, success or
//      failure. Every run leaked a browser tree. Vira found 81 orphans this
//      afternoon; I reaped 152 on this port a few hours later.
//   2. A second run cannot bind 9431, so its own chromium dies — and `cdp(9431)`
//      then attaches to the PREVIOUS RUN'S BROWSER and drives that. The process
//      spawned and the process measured were two browsers with nothing checking
//      they were the same one. A run goes quiet instead of red, which is the
//      worst way for an instrument to fail.
//
// Fixed BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by a check: `--remote-debugging-port=0` gets
// a kernel-assigned port, and the endpoint is parsed off MY OWN CHILD'S stderr.
// There is no shared name left to collide on, so "is this my browser?" stops
// being a question the tool has to get right. `menufit` has done it this way all
// along (`tools/menufit.mjs:161`) — I had the answer in the tree and did not use
// it. This also ends a collision I did not own: `contrast-audit.mjs:545` picks
// `9222 + (pid % 400)` = 9222…9621, a range that CONTAINS 9431, so it would
// silently take this tool's browser about one run in four hundred.

// 89%. This tool fires every four hours. tools/browser.mjs gives Chrome a

// app has ever written that global, so the reader was `null` on every MISS this
// tool has ever printed, and the suffix could only ever be absent. Vira met it
// on a page that had visibly lost its modal and was told nothing, which is the
// whole cost: A READER THAT IS ALWAYS SILENT AND A READER WITH NOTHING TO SAY
// PRINT THE SAME THING, and only one of them is honest.
//
// Deleted rather than given a writer, and that is the same call the three above

  - a landmark present is not a screen CORRECT: this asserts the screen mounted
    and painted text, never that its numbers are right (Vira).
  - two shapes only (390x844, 1200x730); everything between is unphotographed.
  - the driven screens depend on a control's selector; if a button is renamed
    the drive fails LOUD (a MISS), never silently photographs the wrong screen.
  - DENOMINATOR 2's edge, and it is the one worth reading: there is no single
    home listing the tabbed SURFACES, only three homes each listing its own
    members. This run enumerated the three it was told about. A fourth tabbed
    surface added in a fourth place would not appear in any number above — it
    would be missing, silently, exactly as the fifteen sub-surfaces were before
    this change. The sets known to exist and not enumerated are printed as
    NOT ENUMERATED at the top of this run.
  - a sub-surface asserted is a panel that SELECTED, PAINTED TEXT, and rendered
    something no sibling in its set renders. It is NOT a panel whose contents
    are right (Vira) or readable (Sunna): Vira swapped the Stats tab's handler
    for the Deck's and all 56 shots stayed green, because a wrong-but-non-empty
    panel is distinct from its siblings and full of text. All thirty sub-surface
    shots are blind to that, by construction, and it is why this block exists.
  - the property compares members WITHIN a set. It cannot see a set whose every
    member is wrong together, and it says nothing about correctness — two
    distinct, authored layouts can both be bad.
  - the denominators are read from src/ and the photographs are of
    dist/AshenSpire.html. This run proves every DECLARED member exists in that
    artifact, so the bundle is not older than the source in the way that hides
    a surface. It does NOT prove the artifact matches src/ in general — a bundle
    carrying something src/ no longer has passes here. That is
    node tools/verify-shipped.mjs, and it is a separate command.`);

// FLOAT CENTRING / CLIP ASSERTION (#69) — Rune, re-applied onto the canonical
// harness after Marina ruled Bjorn's copy canonical: mine carried fixed sleeps,
// and a float assertion running under fixed sleeps against a possibly-stale
// page is an assertion that can pass while blind. It now stands on this file's
// own guarantees — waitForUrl (we are on the document we asked for) and
// waitFor (the landmark exists) — instead of guessing at time.
//
// It spawns the exact strings Bjorn measured through the SHIPPED floatNum
// (window.__fxProbe, dev-only, ?shot= URLs only) and reads the RENDERED rect.
//
// THREE THINGS THIS ASSERTION HAD TO LEARN, each after it lied once, kept here
// because each is a way an instrument passes while blind:
//  1. Anchor. The clip lives on the RIGHTMOST combatant; anchored to the
//     leftmost it reported everything in-box and could not have failed.
//  2. Jitter. floatNum offsets by Math.random()*26-13, so the defect is
//     intermittent — a probe that rolls the dice reports the roll. Math.random
//     is pinned to the worst case the shipped code can emit (+13 right, -13
//     left).
//  3. The measured quantity. Clipping only shows when a wide string meets a
//     right-hand anchor, so a screen whose rightmost sprite sits 20px further
//     in reads clean while the bug is fully present. The deterministic
//     quantity — and the one Bjorn's per-string table reports — is the CENTRE
//     ERROR: floats are meant to sit centred on their anchor, and floatNum
//     centred them with a hardcoded half-width, so the error was
//     (realHalfWidth - thatConstant). Clipping is its consequence, not its
//     cause. And the rect must be read with the pop animation frozen, because
//     num-pop animates scale() and a mid-animation read shrank a 139px string
//     and a 15px one to the same 45px.
