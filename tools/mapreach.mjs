// tools/mapreach.mjs — can a player REACH every map node, and what can they see
// AT REST, at every shape, every text size, every map zoom, on more than one map?
//
// TWO QUESTIONS, AND THEY ARE NOT THE SAME QUESTION. This is the 2026-08-08
// widening and it is the whole point of it, so it goes first.
//
//   "can the player get to every node"    is REACH.    A node the map can bring
//                                                      wholly on screen at some
//                                                      pan offset is REACHED.
//   "is every node visible at rest"       is AT REST.  What the port holds at the
//                                                      offset the map lands on.
//
// A green on the first says NOTHING about the second. Chrome that grows and eats
// the scrollport pushes nodes out of the resting view while every one of them
// stays reachable by panning — a COST, not a defect — and a tool that reports one
// number cannot tell you which of the two just changed. So this file answers both,
// separately, prints both denominators, and floors both (see POPULATION GUARDS).
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT tools/screenreach.mjs. That sweep hit-tests controls AT REST,
// says so in its own boundary, and is right to: it covers six screens and a
// screen has one layout. The act map does not. It is a pannable canvas whose
// node positions are a function of FIVE things:
//
//   viewport shape x TEXT SIZE x the map's own zoom ladder (1 -> 2) x scroll offset x SEED
//
// and the defect that started this was a coincidence between one of those
// positions and a floating button. Sunna measured two map nodes at 412x915
// sitting under the map's own zoom stack — visible, and pressing one zoomed the
// map instead of travelling. Panning did not rescue them: the canvas slides, the
// buttons do not, so a different node takes the trap. #24 had already "fixed"
// this once, at 390x844, with `padding-bottom` on the canvas — which pads the
// CONTENT while the buttons were pinned to the SCROLLPORT, so it held at exactly
// the offset it was measured at. A check that reads one shape at one offset on
// one seed cannot tell that fix from a real one. Both are green.
//
// AND ONE MAP WAS NOT THE MAP. Until EldenSpire#28 the ?shot=map seed was a
// literal, so every reachability number this repo has ever printed about the act
// map described a single graph. `?shotSeed=` exists for this tool.
//
// AND THE TEXT AXIS DID NOT EXIST HERE AT ALL, WHICH IS WHY THIS FILE CHANGED.
// #117 made the map's zoom buttons meet the 44px tap floor. The taller bar took
// 17-35 CSS px of scrollport, and at four cells it took a node's standing room:
//
//   320x640 Text S  18 -> 17 nodes wholly inside at rest
//   320x640 Text M  18 -> 17
//   360x640 Text L  16 -> 15
//   360x640 Text XL 15 -> 14
//
// mapreach printed PASS over 918 readings at that ref and was RIGHT to: nothing
// was trapped and nothing became unreachable. It was also SILENT, because
// 320x640 was not in its shape list and it never varied text size. THE FOUR
// CELLS WERE EXACTLY THE CELLS THIS TOOL COULD NOT SEE. A green whose population
// excludes the cells where the defect lives is a green with a hole in it, and
// widening the population is the fix — not a new threshold.
//
// WHAT IT ASSERTS — four checks. The first is the one that closes the class:
//
//   STRUCTURE (per shape x text): the zoom bar is not inside the map scrollport's
//     subtree and is laid out in normal flow. Exact, structural, no geometry and
//     no threshold: an element outside the scrolled subtree, in the flow, cannot
//     be over the scrolled content at ANY offset, on ANY seed, at ANY zoom.
//
//   TRAPPED (per cell x pan offset): no map node that is WHOLLY inside the
//     scrollport's visible client box is answered by something else on a hit-test
//     at its centre.
//
//   REACH (per cell): every node can be brought wholly inside the visible port by
//     scrolling, AND is untrapped there. Feasible offsets are computed exactly
//     from each node's content-space box (no grid to step over a node), then the
//     tool SCROLLS THERE AND LOOKS. Analytic and empirical must agree; a
//     disagreement is red, not a rounding footnote.
//
//   AT REST (per cell): the resting view is reported as `n/N wholly inside`, and
//     two things about it are asserted — at least one node is wholly inside
//     (a resting map you can tap nothing on is a defect), and every node the
//     game marks `.reachable` — the ones it is inviting you to press right now —
//     is wholly inside and untrapped AT THE CAMERA THE GAME CHOSE. The COUNT is
//     reported, never asserted: a fixed floor on it would be a number fitted to
//     today's chrome, and the count legitimately falls as text grows. Read it as
//     the price tag. After a manual + or - the offset is a residue of the
//     player's own action, so an invited node off that screen is REPORTED with
//     its magnitude, not failed on — see the note at the check itself.
//
// Structure is what makes the trap impossible; trapped is the known-bad that
// proves structure is worth having; reach and at-rest are the two questions the
// player actually has. Keep all four: the invariant alone would pass a tree where
// somebody re-armed the overlay by a different mechanism, and the symptom alone
// is a property of whichever seed you happened to sweep.
//
// WHY "WHOLLY INSIDE" AND NOT "CENTRE INSIDE", and it is not a fitted number.
// Under a fractional --ui-zoom two abutting boxes share a seam that Chromium
// hit-tests to the lower one for up to ~0.8 CSS px: measured at 360x640, the
// scrollport ends at y=606.22 and elementFromPoint(x, 605.5) already answers
// .map-zoom. A node centre in that seam belongs to a node that is ~2% visible at
// the very bottom edge, which no player is aiming at and one pixel of scrolling
// reveals. Requiring the whole node box inside the port draws the line at
// "visible enough to invite a tap" rather than at a tolerance, and it is
// deliberately STRICTER than screenreach's centre test everywhere else: a node
// fully on screen and under a button is exactly the defect, at any offset.
//
// POPULATION GUARDS — a green is a claim about a population, so the population
// is checked before the green is printed. Each of these exits 2 (unknown), never
// 1 (red) and never 0: they say "this run did not test what it says it tested."
//
//   1. NODE COUNT AGREES ACROSS EVERY CELL OF A SEED. The graph is a function of
//      the seed alone. A cell that reads 6 nodes where its siblings read 44 half
//      mounted, and its clean sweep is meaningless. Derived from the run, never
//      typed: no constant to drift (Law 1 clause 2).
//   2. THE TEXT AXIS MUST BE OBSERVED TO MOVE. Four text sizes that render at one
//      root font-size are one reading printed four times. This guard exists
//      because the author's last two instruments both passed against a tree he
//      knew was broken — one pressed `+` then `-` on one board and reported that
//      the keys did nothing. A swept axis that does not move IS that bug.
//   3. THE AT-REST ASSERTION MUST HAVE A SUBJECT. Zero `.reachable` nodes means
//      the strongest at-rest check ruled on nothing (SOP 2's referent clause) —
//      unknown, not a pass.
//   4. CONTENT-SPACE BOXES MUST BE STABLE UNDER SCROLL — MEASURED AGAINST A
//      CONTROL. REACH is solved from the claim that a node's position in the
//      canvas does not depend on where the canvas is scrolled to. That claim is
//      measured per cell: read at rest, read AGAIN at rest, then read at
//      mid-travel. The standstill pair is the control, because the nodes are
//      ANIMATED (map.css:100, stroke-width 3 -> 5.5) and a stroked circle's box
//      breathes; without the control the animation reads as scroll drift, which
//      is what the first draft of this guard reported at 8.69 local px. Only the
//      EXCESS over the control is evidence about scroll. Both numbers are
//      printed, and the larger is spent as a solve margin.
//   5. Shapes, readings and structure checks must all be non-zero (the original
//      guard, kept).

// THIS IS THE THIRD SHAPE LIST IN tools/ AND IT IS A KNOWN DEFECT, NOT A DESIGN
// — AND IT IS, VERBATIM, A RE-OPEN TRIGGER ON EldenSpire#28.
//
// #28 says: "Re-opened if the shape leaves either list, if A THIRD INSTRUMENT
// LANDS WITH A FOURTH LIST, or if a control is found covered at any shape in
// either list." This file is that third instrument. I am not going to let that
// clause be discovered by someone else later: screenreach.mjs carries four
// shapes, mobilefit.mjs nine, this one seven, and #28's condition 3 — one fact,
// which shapes we support, must not have independent homes — is further from
// met than it was before I wrote this.
//
// It is written this way anyway, for one reason: screenreach.mjs is being
// rewritten on two unmerged branches at once (Sunna's 6f4a9bd, Rune's 7d784a2)
// and a third uncoordinated edit to it was the collision the family had already
// decided to avoid. So the choice was a fourth list or a fourth touch, and the
// fourth list is the one that is visible in a diff and cannot merge silently.
// The collapse — one module, three importers — belongs to the tools-only PR that
// already has to reconcile that file, and it should absorb this list with the
// other two rather than after them.
//   412x915 is the shape the defect was found at.
//   884x1326 is the tablet that takes data-layout=narrow at zoom 1.70 — the one
//     shape where the narrow rules fire in 520 local px instead of ~433.
//   320x640 was ADDED 2026-08-08 and it did not invent a shape: menufit.mjs,
//     actionreach.mjs and tapsize.mjs already carry it, so the house has
//     supported it for longer than this sweep has existed. It is the smallest
//     shape we claim, it is where #117's node loss was worst, and its absence
//     here is the reason this tool was silent about it. Adding it makes the
//     shape-list drift WORSE by one row and better by one cell; the collapse
//     above is now overdue by five lists, not three, and that is the honest
//     accounting rather than a reason to leave the hole open.

//
// THE HYPHENS ARE GONE AND THEY WERE NOT COSMETIC. These two read `MAPREACH-B`
// and `MAPREACH-C` from the day this tool was written until 2026-08-08, and
// NEITHER OF THEM WAS A SEED. src/engine/rng.js:137 defines the seed alphabet as
// 35 characters — digits and A-Z with no O — and `seedFromString` THROWS on any
// character outside it. `-` is outside it. main.js:561 catches that throw and
// substitutes `seedFromString(randomSeedString())`, which is `Math.random()`.
// So every boot of `?shotSeed=MAPREACH-B` built A DIFFERENT MAP, silently:
// measured at one shape, six boots of one URL returned 39, 38, 36, 29, 35 and 35
// nodes with six different graphs, while `SHOWCASE` returned 44 nodes and one
// fingerprint six times out of six — and passing NO shotSeed at all returned
// that same fingerprint, which is the tell that the parameter was doing nothing.
//
// What that costs, stated plainly: this tool's "three seeds" was one seed and
// two unrepeatable random maps. Its sweep was WIDER than advertised and its
// evidence was NOT RE-RUNNABLE — a red found on seed B could not be reproduced
// by anyone, including the run that found it. Quality Gate check 1, failed by
// the instrument rather than by the thing measured. The node-count guard below
// caught it and exited 2; that is the only reason this paragraph exists.

// preflight below rather than by me re-implementing the parser here.

// map zoom on the FIRST seed, and every extra seed is crossed with every shape
// and every map zoom at the DEFAULT text size. The text x extra-seed corner is
// therefore UNSWEPT — named in the boundary, not silently dropped. It is the
// right corner to leave: text size changes the CHROME (how much port is left),
// the seed changes the GRAPH (where nodes are), and #117's loss lived in the
// first at the first seed. A defect that needs both a rare seed and a non-default
// text size to appear would be missed by this run.
const TEXT_DEFAULT = 'M';

// GUARD 4 HAS NO TYPED TOLERANCE, AND THE FIRST DRAFT OF IT DID — that is worth
// the paragraph, because the number looked measured and was fitted.
//
// REACH is solved from each node's CONTENT-SPACE box: where it sits in the
// canvas, independent of where the canvas is scrolled. That is a claim, so the
// tool measures it — read every node, scroll to the middle of the travel, read
// again, and take the worst disagreement. On the shipped tree it is sub-pixel at
// map zoom 0 (0.97 local px at 320x640, 0.82 at 360x640): the conversion from
// visual px (getBoundingClientRect) to local px (scrollLeft) runs through a
// fractional --ui-zoom, so a rect rounding lands here divided by the zoom.
//
// The first draft turned those two readings into `DRIFT_CEILING = 2.0` and
// voided any cell above it. Then the map-zoom +4 cells came in at 2.13, 2.32 and
// 2.93 — the same artefact on a canvas scaled twice as big — and the guard
// declared four healthy cells unknown. A ceiling drawn around the cells I had
// already looked at is the identical mistake as a shape list drawn around them,
// which is the mistake this whole file is being widened to fix.
//
// So the drift is no longer a threshold. It is a MARGIN, measured per cell and
// carried into the solve: a window is only called empty when it is empty by more
// than the drift observed in that very cell, and a node whose window is thinner
// than the drift is reported UNKNOWN rather than counted either way. The verdict
// that matters stays empirical — the tool scrolls to the solved offset and looks.
// The only thing left that can void a cell is derived from the frame, not typed:
// drift as large as the smallest node's own box means content space is not
// invariant in any useful sense, and nothing here can be believed.
