// tools/receipts.mjs — EVERY MERGED PULL REQUEST HAS A RECEIPT BEFORE IT IS PROMOTED.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR, and it is not hypothetical: #629, #631, #635,
// #637, #640, #645, #648, #649 and #650 each landed on `dev` with no entry in
// CHANGELOG.md. Every one was found later, by a person reading the merge log
// against the file and noticing a gap — #633 came back for #629 four merges
// afterwards, and #641 came back for three at once. The in-game changelog is a
// projection of that file (#189), so a missing receipt is missing for a PLAYER
// too, not only for the repository.
//
// Nothing was broken in any of those cases. That is exactly why it kept
// happening: an unreceipted merge is green, ships, and reads as finished. The
// only thing that ever caught it was attention, and attention does not scale
// past the third merge in an evening.
//
// THE RULE, and it is bounded on purpose: every merged pull request that is on
// this branch AND NOT YET on the promotion target must be named by
// some receipt in CHANGELOG.md. The bound is what makes this affordable and
// what makes it meaningful — the question is never "has every merge in history
// got a receipt" (they have not, and the file's own header says which stretch
// is deliberately unreconstructed). The question is "is this promotion
// complete", asked while the answer can still be acted on.
//
// THREE SHAPES A MERGE ARRIVES IN, because GitHub writes more than one and a
// gate that knows only one is blind to the rest — #1262 and #1269 landed as
// squashes and #1268 as a hand-titled merge, and this tool passed all three:
//   · `Merge pull request #N from …`  a merge commit, anywhere in the range
//   · `Merge PR #N: …`                a merge commit whose subject was edited
//   · `… (#N)`                        a squash or rebase merge — counted ONLY on
//     the first-parent line of the branch, where GitHub puts it. Inside a pull
//     request's own history the same suffix is an author's reference, not a
//     landing, and counting it would demand receipts for merges that never were.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT CHECK, stated so the silence is a decision:
//   · whether the receipt is TRUE. Prose is not machine-checkable, and a gate
//     that pretended otherwise would license worse prose, not better.
//   · whether the ordinal on a receipt is the one committed at that merge, for
//     any merge but the pull request `--pr` names. History is not re-derived
//     here; tools/about-changelog.mjs owns the file's shape and order (and
//     rejects only a stamp AHEAD of the committed build), this its coverage.
//
// WHAT `--pr` DOES CHECK ON THE STAMP, because #1315's receipt read
// `0.7.1.518` while its merge commit shipped box 519 and every gate was green:
// the named pull request's receipt must carry exactly the release and ordinal
// of `buildordinal.json` in the tree being checked — the box that pull request
// ships. On `pull_request` that tree is GitHub's merge of the head into the
// base, and a head rebuilt against a moved base conflicts on buildordinal.json
// rather than merging, so the tree's box is the pull request's own.
//   · direct landings that name no pull request. A receipt names a pull
//     request; a commit that has none cannot be named by one, and the file's
//     header already records that class rather than hiding it.
//
// Usage
//   node tools/receipts.mjs --check              origin/test..HEAD (the promotion)
//   node tools/receipts.mjs --check --since dev  any other range

//                                                number must carry a receipt,
//                                                stamped with this tree's
//                                                buildordinal.json box
//   node tools/receipts.mjs --check --pr auto    the same, N read from the
