// tools/card-drag-targeting.mjs — browser acceptance for #150 + #198 + #311
// + #294c.
//
// #294c ADDS FOUR CELLS AND A COUNTED VERDICT LINE.
//
// The four are every OTHER reading of the sentence #311 fixed — "if a card is
// selected and the enemy is highlighted, I can't drag the card on the enemy to
// use it." #311 proved ONE of them (a slow press, the read OPEN). The rest were
// unexercised, and the fix's own comment ASSERTS one in prose: "while merely
// pending, a real drag crossing the shared 12 px boundary abandons the inspect
// in the same event and proceeds here." A claim with no cell behind it.
//   1 · ALREADY SELECTED, THEN DRAGGED FAST — one move, no dwell, and the move
//       that starts the drag must also AIM it.
//   2 · CARD A SELECTED WHILE CARD B IS DRAGGED — the card that plays is named
//       by instanceId, so "which one" is a fact and not a count.
//   3 · A MEDIUM DRAG — a dwell at 0.65 of the MEASURED dial, exactly one play.
//   4 · A TOUCH DRAG off a selected card — real Input.dispatchTouchEvent, every
//       pointerdown read back with its pointerType.
// Each has a plant; each plant was watched red at 1200x730 before it was
// written down, and every mouse cell stays green under cell 4's.
//
// THE VERDICT LINE NOW ENDS AT ITS COUNTED CLAIM. This tool used to print
// "PASS — card drag targeting … at every measured shape", which readVerdict
// (tools/verdict.mjs) refuses outright: prose after the counted claim is
// unrecognised grammar (D103). It was one of the ~40 that ruling named and left
// to "whoever wraps next". The count is derived by incrementing as each check is
// evaluated, never typed. And the BOUNDARY prints on every exit path — green,
// red, a run that dies in the harness, and `--selftest` — proved by a plant
// (the hand draws no card; exit 2, boundary printed) rather than by reading it.
//
// THAT CLAIM WAS FALSE FOR THE PATHS ABOVE `main()`, AND IT WAS FALSE IN THE
// COMMIT THAT MADE IT. `--text typo` threw at module scope, above the guarded
// `main().then(…).catch(…)`, and exited 1 with an empty stdout: no verdict, no
// boundary. Fixed two ways, because one of them only fixes one line — the
// argument checks moved INTO `main()` so a bad flag is a named refusal, and an
// `uncaughtException` net registered beside finish() so any OTHER module-scope
// death (the `--selftest` branch reads four files and resolves an import up
// there too) still prints the extent. NO PLANT REACHES EITHER: the corpus
// mutates source and runs this tool, and both of these die before a source file
// is read. Same class as the `--selftest` ordering bug above — run the flag,
// read the LAST line.
//
// The same real page and pointer door checks the approved hand paging controls,
// drag start, nearest-only single target switching, all-target multi aim,
// non-targeting silence, one legal commit, zero illegal commits, cleanup on
// both endings, and Text XL pager geometry. `--selftest` plants each accepted
// defect back through this same browser door.
//
// #311 ADDS TWO CELLS TO THE SAME DOOR, because both are facts about what a
// DRAG does and this file is where the next drag change will run them.
//   * A READ YIELDS TO A DRAG. The inspect dial (balance.ui.inspectHold, 400 ms)
//     starts at pointerdown, so any press slower than that to its first 12 px
//     used to open the read and never give the press back. Measured red at
//     four shapes before the fix, 4/4. The cell waits on `data-inspect="open"`
//     rather than timing a camera against the dial — the attribute is what
//     holdconfirm.js publishes for exactly this.
//   * A SELF-ONLY CARD NAMES ITS ONE TARGET. Constantine: "dragging a block
//     should default highlight player character since it can only target that
//     character." `friendlyTargetMode` (model/friendlyTargets.js) is the one
//     home of that predicate; the colour is #209's TARGET_COLORS.self and is
//     read from the DOM here rather than re-typed.

// THE FATAL LATCH, AND IT EXISTS BECAUSE THE FLUSH FIX TOOK ONE AWAY. Moving

// made a fatal exit FINAL. Take it away and the exit code becomes a variable
// that anything reaching finish() later can reassign, INCLUDING A SUCCESS PATH
// ALREADY IN FLIGHT. Found by Codex on `e387131` and reproduced here by
// producing the false pass rather than by reading the code: a non-EADDRINUSE
// server error (`tools/serve.mjs:149` rethrows one) arriving while main() is
// still running took the exit code from 2 to 0 and printed
// `OK — 45 checks passed`, and `tools/verdict.mjs` read that and reported
// `verdict: OK — 45`, exit 0. A fatal error through the gate as a full green,
// which is the worst state in this house.

//
// AND IT IS WHY THE HANDLER CALLS IT AT ALL: finish() only sets

  // shape (180 checks, ~27 KB) run as `node tools/verdict.mjs -- node <stub>`
  // with stdout piped lost its tail on 10 of 20 runs emitted in ONE TICK — and
  // on 5 of 40 STREAMED, which the earlier note said was safe. It is not.
  // STREAMING THE BODY BUYS NOTHING, BECAUSE THE TAIL IS ALWAYS ONE TICK: the
  // verdict line and this boundary are written in a single burst whatever the
  // body did. EIGHT OF THE NINE LOSSES cut at a buffer boundary — 23087 bytes on
  // the one-tick stub (4 of 4), 23089 on the streamed one (4 of 5), every one at
  // check 172 of 180. THE NINTH is the one that shows the failure mode: it cut at
  // 24153 with all 180 PASS lines intact, losing ONLY the verdict and the
  // boundary. (This comment first said "every lost run cut at 23087" — true of one
  // stub, false of the set. The run that breaks the pattern is the evidence.)

// THE FIX AND THE HOLE IN ONE COMMIT, AGAIN — and that is why the net is here
// rather than one more moved line. `main()` is guarded: `.then(finish).catch((e)
// => finish(2, …))` at the bottom of this file, so every death INSIDE it prints
// the boundary. Everything at MODULE SCOPE runs ABOVE that guard and had
// nothing. Measured at 725ca10a: `node tools/card-drag-targeting.mjs --text typo`
// threw at the argument check, exited 1 with ZERO bytes on stdout — no verdict
// line, no boundary — which breaks the every-exit-path claim this file's own
// header makes. It is the same defect as gatelist's G3, where `process.exit(2)`
// sat above both refusal prints; mine, one round later.
//
// A PER-INSTANCE FIX WOULD LEAVE THE CLASS OPEN IN THIS SAME FILE. The
// `--selftest` branch below is module scope too: `lines()` reads four source
// files off disk and `import('./doorplant.mjs')` resolves, all above the guard.
//
// AND IT IS NOT ONLY A MODULE-SCOPE NET, WHICH IS THE HALF I GOT WRONG FIRST.
// `uncaughtException` is process-wide: it also catches an async callback that
// throws while main() is RUNNING, and that case needs the latch and the cleanup
// above, not just a printed boundary. Restricting the handler to initialization
// would have left that case uncovered; latching covers both with one mechanism.
//
// MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED — node v22.22.2, four death shapes, all four caught: a
// synchronous top-level throw; a rejected top-level `await import(...)`; a throw
// after a top-level await; and a `setTimeout` throw from inside `serve.mjs`'s
// own error branch, planted as file bytes in a copied real tree.
//
// REGISTERED HERE, and the position is load-bearing: it must sit BELOW the
// `fatal` / `finished` / `boundaryPrinted` / `checks` / `fails` declarations,
// because the handler body reaches those bindings and a TDZ read inside a crash
// handler is a second crash — the same temporal-dead-zone mistake this file
// already made once, two commits back. It must sit ABOVE the first module-scope
// statement that can throw, which is the `--selftest` branch immediately below.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER, stated positively: the four static `import`s at the
// top of this file. Those reject before any of this module's code exists, so no
// handler of ours can be registered yet. That path still dies bare — and
// `verdict.mjs` still names it HARNESS COULD NOT RUN, exit 2, which is correct.
// Nor does it cover a SIGKILL, which no handler can; `verdict.mjs` calls that
// KILLED, exit 4.
