// tools/flaskbox.mjs — A FLASK THAT IS A CONTROL HAS ONE BOX, AND IT IS AT THE
// FLOOR. The rendered check on the flask CHIP, on every surface that draws one.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS, and the reason is the same shape as tools/placement.mjs's.
// Until 2026-08-17 the same flask, drawn as something a player TAPS, had three
// boxes and only one of the three declared anything. Measured at dev = b83bda1
// on the real boots, before a line changed:
//
//   .coop-flask   min-height: var(--tap-floor); height: auto   — the right one
//                 (retired 2026-10-01: co-op flasks moved behind Potions)
//   .flask-slot   borrowed `.topbar .relic`'s width/height: 2.6rem
//                 -> 54.2 x 26.0 local px at 390x844 AND 1200x730, against a
//                 --tap-target of 44. 41% under the house floor, on the control
//                 a player spends a flask with, every fight. Its own quick-use
//                 keycap was drawn 5.8 px BELOW it, over the build stamp, with
//                 27% of the flask art under the cap.
//   .mh-flask     declared NOTHING. A bare <button>, so base.css's generic
//                 `padding: 1rem 2.6rem` sized it: 81.2 x 49.2 around a 20 px
//                 glyph, three times the relic chip beside it, and map.css told
//                 it `cursor: default` while it mounted an action menu.
//
// NO GREP FINDS THAT, WHICH IS THE POINT. tools/flaskpresentation.mjs reads all
// three of those files and passes — it reads SOURCE TEXT and two thirds of this
// defect is an ABSENCE. `tools/tapsize.mjs` owns the tap floor and names four
// selectors, none of them a flask. So the only instrument that could see it was
// a photograph, and this is that photograph turned into a predicate.
//
// WHAT IT CHECKS, per shape:
//   B1 FLOOR      every flask control's rendered box is at least the floor THE
//                 PAGE ITSELF resolves. The floor is MEASURED, never parsed: a
//                 probe element with `height: var(--tap-floor)` is appended and
//                 its offsetHeight read (tapsize.mjs's lesson — getPropertyValue
//                 hands back the literal `calc(...)`, and parseFloat of that is
//                 NaN printing as 0, which looks like a measurement).
//   B2 CONTAINED  nothing inside a flask control is drawn outside the control's
//                 own box. This is the keycap, and it is stated as containment
//                 rather than as a number so it cannot be satisfied by moving
//                 the badge somewhere else that also hangs out.
//   B3 ONE BOX    the flask control is the SAME HEIGHT on every surface that
//                 draws one. Law 0 clause 4 as a predicate: no threshold, no
//                 invented number — three surfaces, one answer, or red. This is
//                 the one that catches "the map flask is the generic button",
//                 which B1 alone cannot see (81 x 49 clears a 44 floor).
//
// AND ONE THING IT REPORTS AND REFUSES TO ASSERT: how it reached the map.
// `?shot=map` boots a FRESH run — main.js seeds `run.flasks` only inside its
// `combat || fx` branch — so the map's `.mh-flasks` mount is EMPTY BY
// PRECONDITION there, not by defect. That cost a night: the emptiness was
// carried as a named `unknown` and read as a missing feature. So this tool
// reaches the map the way a player does — ?shot=shop, buy the shelf, LEAVE —
// and prints which door it used. Whether main.js should also pose a flask on
// ?shot=map is a harness call and not this tool's to make.
//
// THE DOOR: the SOURCE TREE over http in headless Chromium (serve.mjs), every
// box read off getBoundingClientRect and converted to LOCAL px once before
// anything is compared. Synthesized DOM clicks, not CDP input — so this
// measures where a control IS, never whether a thumb can reach it
// (tools/actionreach.mjs, tools/screenreach.mjs own that).
//
// BOUNDARY: two viewports, 390x844 and 1200x730, at the DEFAULT settings.
// The settings sweep — Text S..XL must not move the box, Minimum tap size 24/44
// must — is measured but NOT asserted here; it is one shape of evidence in
// gamedesign/sunna/log/2026/2026-08-17_the-flask-that-had-three-boxes.md and it
// belongs with tapsize.mjs's dial if anyone wants it re-run.
//
//   node tools/flaskbox.mjs
//   node tools/flaskbox.mjs --selftest      (same-door known-bads, doorplant.mjs)
//   node tools/flaskbox.mjs --source-selftest (focus/surface contracts; no browser)

// A NOTE ON THIS ORDINARY-LOOKING IMPORT, because it was not ordinary for two
// hours and the record should say who fixed it. At dev = b83bda1 `browser.mjs`
// ended with `if (process.argv.includes('--selftest')) await selftest();` — a
// bare argv scan at MODULE-EVALUATION time, so a static import ran the
// LAUNCHER's bench and process.exit()ed before the importing tool's own
// selftest block was reached. I hit it building this file and measured it:
//
//   $ node tools/placement.mjs --selftest        (at b83bda1)
//   browser --selftest — /usr/bin/chromium       <- and then it exits
//
// VIRA FOUND IT INDEPENDENTLY AND FIXED IT IN THE SAME HOUR (e05be89: the guard
// now fires only when browser.mjs is the entry module). This tool imports
// statically like every other one because of her fix, not in spite of it.
// Counted on THIS tree rather than repeating her number: 46 tools import the
// launcher and 13 of those declare a `--selftest` of their own. Her commit says
// 24 importers were hijacked; the two counts are of different sets and I am
// naming that rather than reconciling them into one I did not derive. Neither
// number is a claim that those benches have now been RUN — her commit says so
// too, and it is still the open finding.

// WHAT MOVED, 2026-09: every flask control on every surface is now the kit's
// Slot (styles/kit.css § SLOT, src/ui/kit/index.js slot()), so THE BOX THIS TOOL
// WAS WRITTEN ABOUT HAS ONE HOME instead of three. F1 and F4 below are the same
// two questions asked of that home: F1 that the map's Slot still carries the
// `flask-slot` hook the unified cursor's chrome exception reads, and F4 that the
// kit owns the box — `.as-slot` sizes itself from `--iconbtn-size` and NO screen
// stylesheet re-declares a width or height for `.mh-flask`. The old F4 asserted
// a shared `.topbar .relic.flask-slot, .topbar .mh-flask` rule in ui.css; that
// rule is gone because the sharing is no longer a selector list, it is the atom.
// `map` IS THE RUN HUD (components/runHud.js since 2026-09-11, #977): the
// map's band became the one band every room mounts, and the utility flask
// row moved out of map.js with it. The key keeps its name; the file moved.
