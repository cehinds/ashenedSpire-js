// A CAPTURE THAT IS NOT REPRODUCIBLE IS NOT EVIDENCE, AND THIS RACE IS STILL OPEN.

// The bug: a one-shot `--screenshot` fires whenever virtual time expires, and
// sometimes that is before the screen's content has finished coming up. The
// result is a half-faded frame — full layout, everything dim — that looks like
// a design choice rather than a fault. Nothing about it reads as wrong.
//
// I have already reported this fixed once, by raising --virtual-time-budget
// from 8s to 20s. THAT WAS WRONG. Measured afterwards over five full runs, 3 of
// 5 still produced one dim frame, in a DIFFERENT shot each time, and raising
// the budget further does not converge it — the capture point is simply not
// tied to the page being ready.
//
// So this does not try to out-wait the race. It requires the frame to be
// REPRODUCIBLE: capture twice, keep it only if the two are byte-identical.
// Measured across three clean runs, every `stable` shot here is byte-identical
// run to run, so agreement is a real bar rather than a hopeful one; a frame
// caught mid-fade disagrees with its own retake and is thrown away. After
// MAX_TRIES the run FAILS rather than committing a frame it cannot reproduce.
//
// This is not "run it until it looks right" — the difference is that the
// failure is now loud, and no capture reaches the folder unless the harness
// produced it twice. The screens above with live animation (map, combat, fx,
// the ambient embers) cannot pass this and are not marked `stable`; they are
// still captured once, and still carry the race. Fixing it AT SOURCE means
