// tools/webaudio-stub.mjs — the ONE minimal WebAudio stub the headless audio
// probes share (sfx-gain-probe.mjs, music-silence-probe.mjs). Extracted so the
// stub's hard-won model has one home: it records every value scheduled on a
// GAIN param — both setValueAtTime and exponentialRampToValueAtTime, because
// the engine uses both (tone() ramps up to its peak, noise() sets its peak
// directly and ramps down; the sfx probe's first run missed all four noise
// layers by assuming ramps only, and mixed frequency targets into the pool —
// both wrong models, caught by watching it fail). Frequency params record
// nothing, so a freq can never alibi a gain.
//
// install() MUST run before importing ../src/ui/audio.js — the engine reads
// window.AudioContext at init. Returns the live gainTargets array; truncate it
// (`gainTargets.length = 0`) between probes.
//
// ---- THE GRAPH HALF (#48) --------------------------------------------------
// A flat list of scheduled numbers cannot see a ROUTE, and #48 is a route
// defect: the external track was connected to the bus with no gain stage at
// all, so there was no number anywhere for the old model to be wrong about.
// A probe reading only `gainTargets` reports the same thing whether the mix
// table reaches the asset path or not — which is why nothing in this tree
// could witness the defect Vega measured by hand.
//
// So `connect()` now RECORDS its edge (and still returns its argument, so the
// engine's `a.connect(b).connect(c)` chains are untouched), every scheduled
// value also lands in a second registry that remembers WHICH NODE it was
// scheduled on, and the stub answers `new Audio(url)` +
// `createMediaElementSource(el)` so the external path can be walked at all.
// `stubGraph()` hands a probe the live registry. All of it is additive: the
// `gainTargets` array behaves exactly as it did, which sfx-gain-probe and
// music-silence-probe re-verify by running unchanged.
