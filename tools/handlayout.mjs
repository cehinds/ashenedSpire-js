// tools/handlayout.mjs — the hand-layout word (C2), measured: overlap FITS,
// paging is UNTOUCHED, and every claim is a number from a rendered tree.
//
// WHAT IT CHECKS, per cell (mode x text size, at 390x844, ten-card hand — the
// Hand size stat row pinned to 10 through ?shotSettings, posed through
// ?shotHand which draws by the engine's own door):
//   1. the word derived onto <html data-hand-layout> is the mode asked for —
//      through ?shotSettings, the app's own settings resolution, so a tree
//      without the word fails HERE first, by name
//   2. the hand holds exactly ten cards (the pose reached the edge it claims)
//   3. OVERLAP ONLY — Law 5 clause 1, per scroll container: the hand's
//      horizontal scroll travel is ZERO, and vertical too (the flattened fan
//      must not buy width with a hidden vertical scroller). PAGING: travel is
//      REPORTED, never asserted — the strip is the mode's composition, C2's
//      closed exemption, named here at the container's own check.
//   4. every card is HITTABLE at the centre of its exposed strip:
//      elementFromPoint resolves into that card — drawn width is not the
//      claim, the tappable sliver is (Law 4's spirit: measure the rendered
//      rect a finger meets, not the box the CSS declares)
//   5. sliver widths reported, min named, in local px and on-glass px — the
//      compensating reader for a cramped sliver is the inspect hold
//      (tools/inspecthold.mjs owns that corpus, in both modes)
// Plus one edge cell: overlap x M at a ONE-card hand (the other edge of the
// derivation — no neighbour, no margin, travel still zero).
// In paging cells the tool also prints sha256 of .hand-area's outerHTML so two
// trees can be compared for byte-identity from outside (the C2 ruling that the
// shipped strip keeps its seat is a diffable claim, not a mood).
//
// Usage
//   node tools/handlayout.mjs                      source tree via serve.mjs
//   node tools/handlayout.mjs --root DIR           another tree (the known-bad run)
//   node tools/handlayout.mjs --shots DIR          also write one 390x844 png per cell
//   node tools/handlayout.mjs --selftest           the RE-RUNNABLE known-bad (below)
// Exit: 0 all green · 1 a finding · 2 usage / no browser / NOTHING RAN
//
// OBSERVED RED (the instrument rule), same door as the real input — the mode
// enters by ?shotSettings into the app's own store and derivation:
//   dev 71e3edd (pre-word)      exit 1: check 1 red in every cell by name
//                               (data-hand-layout never appears), check 2 red
//                               (no ?shotHand on that tree — five cards), and
//                               the overlap travel check red on the shipped
//                               scroller. The run is in the branch report;
//                               re-run with --root against any tree.
//   this tree                   exit 0, all cells.
//
// ...AND THAT RED WAS REF-PINNED, WHICH IS WHY --selftest EXISTS (Vira's doors
// audit, 2026-08-14: "SAME-DOOR when run; the known-bad tree is ref-pinned").
// The observation above needs a 71e3edd checkout to exist; under SOP 2's drift
// clause a red that cannot be re-run is `unknown (drifted)`, not coverage. So
// the corpus is now BUILT, not remembered:
//
//   --selftest copies this tree to a scratch dir, edits ONE REAL SOURCE LINE
//   in the copy, and re-runs THIS WHOLE TOOL at --root COPY. Every stage a
//   real regression travels — serve over http, index.html -> src/main.js ->
//   settings resolution -> combat.js's renderHand + applyHandLayout -> the
//   rendered DOM this tool measures — runs on the planted tree. Nothing is
//   handed to a function; the plant is a source edit, because a source edit is
//   how this defect class actually arrives.
//
//   P1 derivation cut   src/main.js stops writing <html data-hand-layout>.
//                       Expect: check 1 red in EVERY cell, by name.
//   P2 overlap cut      applyHandLayout stops writing the negative margin —
//                       the flattened fan is no longer pulled inside the
//                       strip's width.
//                       Expect: Law 5 travel red in the OVERLAP cells while
//                       the paging cells stay green — the mode-inertness claim
//                       and the overlap claim are separable, and this proves
//                       the tool can tell them apart.
//   C  clean control    the untouched copy must go GREEN, or the plants proved
//                       nothing but that copying a tree breaks it.
//
//   THE PLANT IS KEYED TO THE CONTRACT, NOT TO THE PATH — learned the same day
//   it was written. The renderer collapse (Viki, 2026-08-15) moved P2's line
//   from screens/combat.js to components/hand.js WITHOUT ONE BYTE CHANGING,
//   and a plant keyed to the path refused while the contract it guards was
//   alive three directories over. So each plant carries a CLOSED SET of homes
//   the contract has lived in, exactly one of which must hold it exactly once.
//   Not a search: a closed set can be audited and cannot pass silently through
//   a home nobody imagined. Two homes matching is as loud a refusal as none —
//   one contract in two places is the second copy this house exists to catch.
//   Outside the set it still REFUSES at exit 2 and asks to be re-aimed rather
//   than quietly measuring nothing.
//
// BOUNDARY. One shape (390x844) — the word only arranges the NARROW hand; the
// wide fan is one composition in both modes and inspecthold covers it at
// 1200x730. Headless Chromium hit-testing; no real finger. Sliver hittability
// is geometric (elementFromPoint), not a claim about contact patches.
//
// REMOVAL: deleted the day the hand-layout word leaves balance.ui, or a
// browser-level layout harness supersedes CDP measurement.
