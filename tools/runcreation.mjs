// tools/runcreation.mjs — WHO WROTE THIS NUMBER, AND WHAT DID THEY OVERWRITE?
//
// THE DEFECT, FOUND FROM TWO ENDS BY TWO SEATS WHO EACH SAW HALF (Marina's
// ruling, 2026-08-15, R-1/R-2 as one act):
//
//   · Vira: three fields are optional in RUN_SHAPE with NO schemaVersion gate,
//     so a heal written for old saves fires on a CURRENT-schema save too. Delete
//     the allocation from a current-schema save and it loads with the class preset. Silently.
//   · Sten: a planted double-count in the max-HP chain was SWALLOWED, because
//     `reconcileRunLoadoutHp` is the LAST writer at run creation. His instrument
//     went green on a real defect.
//
// One defect: **a last-writer-wins reconcile at run creation that keeps no
// record of what it overwrote.** Nobody owned run creation. This tool does.
//
// WHAT THIS TOOL IS FOR, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY IS NOT.
//   IT IS: the observer of that record. src/model/healLedger.js makes each
//     writer state what it computed and what it replaced; this drives BOTH
//     doors — createRunState AND createSaveManager.loadRun — and goes red when
//     they disagree, when a home stops reporting, or when a heal fires without
//     naming itself (Sten's A7).
//   IT IS NOT the collapse. The max-HP formula still lives in three homes and
//     this act does not merge them: *you cannot safely collapse what you cannot
//     watch drift*, and the swallowed plant is the proof. Collapse is the next
//     act, and it is safe to attempt only once this is green and has been red.
//   IT IS NOT a refusal. Refuse-vs-heal is a false dichotomy (Constantine, C6).
//     The defect is the SILENCE, not the heal. tests/engine.test.js 28 and 50
//     stay GREEN — this tool asserts that they should, in group C.
//
// THE DOOR — printed by door() below, in this run's own output, because an
// observation that cannot name its entry point has not made the claim
// (commons/development.md, *The instrument rule*, same-door clause):
//
//   Doors driven: createRunState({seed,classId,registries}) for the born case,
//   and BYTES under the real key 'sote_run_v1' written by
//   createSaveManager(storage).saveRun and read by .loadRun(registries) for the
//   restored case — the same two calls the game makes at src/main.js persist()
//   and resumeRun(). Registries are the real content boot. Every damaged save
//   in group C is produced by taking a save THIS BUILD WROTE and deleting a
//   field from the JSON, then putting the bytes back under the real key:
//   nothing is handed to normalizeRunAttributes, initializeRunDerivedStats,
//   initializeRunFlaskCharges or reconcileRunLoadoutHp directly. Those are the
//   stages under test.
//
// FOUR GROUPS:
//   A. run creation says what it did — the three-writer chain is on the record
//   B. the two doors agree — every home that spoke said the same number, and a
//      run comes back with the pools it was born with (A7)
//   C. every ungated heal NAMES ITSELF through saves.runStatus(), and a clean
//      save reports 'ok' with zero heals (both edges)
//   D. THE WAKE — see the block above wake() below
//
// SELFTEST: `node tools/runcreation.mjs --selftest` plants five known-bads into
// a COPY of the real tree via tools/doorplant.mjs and runs this whole file from
// that copy, so each plant enters as source bytes on the road the real input
// travels.
//
// REMOVAL CONDITION (SOP 1's corollary): deleted the day run creation and the
// load door have ONE writer per field — no last writer, nothing to overwrite,
// nothing to witness. Collapsing the three homes earns that; this is what makes
// the collapse safe to attempt, not a permanent fixture.

// D. THE WAKE
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// *The wake condition* (commons/development.md, Freja, 2026-08-14): a refusal
// mechanism ships with its wake written as an observable predicate, and the wake
// carries a RED OF ITS OWN — because the refusing half is always green and
// absence never fails a test written to expect absence.
//
// WHAT IS BEING CARRIED, precisely. Marina parked one question: *should a
// current-schema save missing a field be REFUSED instead of healed?* Today it
// heals, deliberately, and tests 28 and 50 say so. That parked call is a
// refusal-to-refuse, and its premise is:
//
//   ┌ THE PREMISE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
//   │ No save this build WRITES is a save this build has to HEAL. Every    │
//   │ current-schema heal observed so far exists because a test deleted a  │
//   │ field on purpose. Nothing in the shipped write path produces one.    │
//   └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
//
// While that holds, healing costs nothing real and refusing buys nothing real —
// which is exactly why the call could be parked. THE DAY IT DIES, it wakes: a
// build that writes saves its own door must repair is a build whose players are
// silently getting plausible allocations, and the refuse question is live.
//
// The check below is the red on the WAKE, not on the refusing: it round-trips
// UNTOUCHED saves through the real door and fails the moment
// `healedOnCurrentSchema` is non-zero. Nothing here asserts that heals happen —
// group C does that, and a suite that only re-proves the refusal watches the
// premise never.
//
// THE HALF A MACHINE CANNOT WATCH, stated rather than implied. Marina's ruling
// gave the wake a second trigger: *the day anyone measures torn writes or quota
// in a browser.* No check in this file can fire on that — every save here lives
// in an in-memory stub. What would count, written down so a third party can
// evaluate it: a run under a real localStorage that observes EITHER a
// QuotaExceededError from saveRun, OR a partially-written value under
// '<RUN_KEY>' after an interrupted write. Either is a shipped writer producing
// a save its own door must heal, i.e. the same premise-death by another road.
// Owner: this seat. It is unmeasured today and that is `unknown`, not green.

BOUNDARY — what this green does NOT cover.

  · IT IS VISIBILITY, NOT A COLLAPSE AND NOT A FIX. The max-HP formula still
    lives in three homes (${Object.keys(MAX_HP_HOMES).length}, named in src/model/healLedger.js). This tool proves
    they AGREE on every case it drives; it does not prove they cannot drift, and
    nothing here merges them. A case this file never builds is a case no home
    was compared on.
  · IT IS SILENT ON WHETHER THE NUMBERS ARE RIGHT. If D22 derives the wrong HP,
    all three homes derive it identically and this tool says PASS. tools/conhp.mjs
    holds the formula; this holds the joint.
  · THE HEALS STILL HEAL. Nothing here refuses anything. A current-schema save
    missing a field still loads with a plausible substitute — it now says so.
    Whether it should refuse is a parked design call (Marina, 2026-08-15) and
    the wake above is what will re-open it.
  · NO BROWSER, ONE RUNTIME. In-memory storage, Node ${process.version} on ${process.platform}.
    Quota refusals and torn writes are UNMEASURED — and they are the second half
    of the wake condition, so that half is 'unknown', not green.
  · THE LEDGER IS OPEN ONLY AT THE TWO DOORS. A writer that touches maxHp
    mid-climb — an event, a relic, a rest — records nothing and is invisible
    here. That is deliberate (bounded cost) and it is a real blind spot.
  · schemaVersion 1 IS STILL ACCEPTED BY migrateRunSchema AND NO FIXTURE IN THIS
    TREE WAS WRITTEN BY A v1 BUILD. Recorded by Marina 2026-08-15 as a refusal
    mechanism with no wake, parked with no seat this wave: either a v1 build
    produces a fixture, or the v1 branch is deleted so v1 fails loud by name.
    Unknown, not green, and aging will not fix it.
