// tools/refusal-audit.mjs — every control that refuses must say why.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR. Constantine, on his phone: "for armament, I can't
// select the empty slot to equip available weapons." The slot opened; what
// opened was seventeen armaments with sixteen locked, and a locked chip had NO
// CLICK HANDLER. He tapped a weapon he could see, nothing happened, nothing was
// said. A control that refuses in silence reads as a broken one.
//
// WHAT IT CHECKS, on the rendered page and never on the source: for every
// element that LOOKS refusing — `[disabled]`, `[aria-disabled=true]`, `.locked`
// — is there a reason the player can get at? The one home for that is
// `data-refusal`, written by components/refusal.js, which cannot mark a control
// without being handed the reason.
//
//   node tools/refusal-audit.mjs                 audit, print the census
//   node tools/refusal-audit.mjs --port 8613     pick the HTTP port
//   node tools/refusal-audit.mjs --shape 390x844 one shape instead of both
//
// THE DENOMINATOR IS FLOORED, NEVER THE FINDINGS (Vira's, via Marina, today): a
// run that examined zero controls has not passed, it has measured nothing, and
// it says so INSTEAD OF printing a boundary. A boundary block is a claim about a
// run that happened. `--only` matching nothing and printing "OK — 0 shots, every
// assertion true" is the shape this is written against; it cost the house a
// false report this morning in a tool whose own author had planted against
// exactly that one commit earlier.
//
// THE BROWSER IT MEASURED IS THE BROWSER IT STARTED, and it proves that rather
// than assuming it: chromium is launched with `--remote-debugging-port=0`, the
// endpoint is read from THAT CHILD'S OWN stderr, and the ws URL is echoed in the
// verdict. Nothing here binds a fixed debugging port, so it can never attach to
// a browser somebody else is driving.
//
// WHAT A GREEN HERE DOES NOT MEAN: it is a claim about the screens this run
// REACHED, listed by name below the verdict, and nothing at all about the ones
// it did not. It walks the routes in ROUTE below and prints that count from the
// table itself; how many screens the game HAS is tools/screen-census.mjs's
// number and is never restated here.

// THIS TABLE HELD A PROBE WHOSE SUBJECT #90 DELETED, and the deletion is the

//
//   "Both pickers are walked on purpose: the armament one refuses for
//    `requireFound`, the armour one for an UNLOCK, and a generic reason in
//    either would be a lie."
//
// Both premises are now false. The picker offers only what the profile owns, so
// it refuses for NOTHING: measured at 77a02b9 the two pickers held 28 refusing
// chips between them (17/16 right hand, 10/9 left, 5/3 armour); after #90 they
// hold 0. The `armoury-armour` route waited on
// `.equip-picker .equip-chip.locked` and could only ever time out — an
// unsatisfiable wait is a red instrument, not a red screen, and it must not be
// left for someone to read as the latter.
//
// So that route is removed rather than re-aimed: the surviving refusal on this
// screen is the slot ladder's next cell, and `armoury-armaments` already walks
// it — it reports both locked cells SPEAKING their rung's own hint. Re-pointing
// the armour route at the same control would be one subject probed twice.
//
// VIKI'S, #90, AND OFFERED AS A FINDING WITH A PATCH RATHER THAN TAKEN: this
// file is not mine. Adopt or refuse it; if refused, the route needs a subject
// that still exists, because it has none today.

// printed two distinct reasons through the census and reported zero through the
// probe, then failed on its own arithmetic. **A tool whose two halves count
// different things cannot be red for a reason you can act on.**
//
// So the probe now draws from the census's predicate, scoped to the surface it
// is standing on. The scope is the point: the property is "a control you can see
// and cannot use must say why, WHERE YOU ARE LOOKING", and that was never a
