# AS-HD-040 — proposed build_rogue for tools/sprites-blender.py
#
# WHY THIS FILE IS HERE AND NOT IN tools/
# tools/** is assigned to owner_role it-support in git-ownership.json. No active
# lease claims it (lease-AS-HD-057-it-support is revoked; its live replacement
# -r2 holds only .agentops/work|events/AS-HD-057/**), but this seat is maker and
# holds assets/classes/** only, so this is a bounded proposal under art.md §3,
# not an edit. See TOOLS-ACCESS-REQUEST.md.
#
# LANDING THIS TAKES THREE EDITS IN TWO FILES. Doing only the first leaves the
# rig-reuse defect exactly where it is.
#
#   1. tools/sprites-blender.py — paste the four materials and build_rogue below
#      beside build_herald, and add "rogue": build_rogue to the builders map.
#
#   2. tools/equipment-blender.py:404 — CLASS_BUILD is a SECOND map, and it
#      still reads {"rogue": lib["build_reaver"]}. equipment-blender execs the
#      library portion of sprites-blender, so build_rogue is already in `lib`
#      once edit 1 lands — but nothing selects it. Change that entry to
#      lib["build_rogue"], or every regenerated body_rogue_*.webp keeps the
#      Reaver rig and this proposal fixes nothing that ships.
#
#   3. tools/equipment-blender.py:427 — CLASS_BODY_MATS["rogue"] still names
#      HERO_PLATE / HERO_PLATE_LT / ROGUE_LEATHER / HERO_UNDER, which are the
#      REAVER's materials. Once rogue has its own geometry those are surfaces
#      the figure no longer owns, and repainting them does nothing visible —
#      which is precisely the shipped bug the comment block above that map
#      documents ("eight of twelve armour sets rendered pixel-identical to
#      their class default"). Replace it with:
#
#          "rogue": {"plate": "ROGUE_SCALE", "plateLt": "ROGUE_SCALE_LT",
#                    "leather": "ROGUE_LEATHER", "under": "ROGUE_UNDER"},
#
#      That map's own rule is that only materials UNIQUE to one class may be
#      listed, or the last set's colour leaks into the next class rendered.
#      That is why the four materials below are rogue-specific rather than
#      borrowed: reusing ROGUE_LEATHER and HERO_UNDER would have made rogue
#      unpaintable on two of its four armour columns. Whoever holds tools/** pastes the function in beside build_herald and
# adds "rogue": build_rogue to the builders map at the bottom, plus the two
# materials below next to the other module-level materials.
#
# WHY IT IS NEEDED
# tools/sprites-blender.py defines build_reaver, build_starseer and
# build_herald. There is no build_rogue anywhere in the repository, and
# tools/equipment-blender.py:408 maps "rogue": lib["build_reaver"] — the exact
# defect the full-body silhouette clause failed on. The owner ruled 2026-09-02
# that rogue is the ONE approved look of the four frozen crops, so the approved
# look is the one with no builder: it exists only as blob 8359517b.
#
# TARGET (measured from that blob — see LOOK-REFERENCE-ROGUE.md §1)
#   88.6% of the figure below v=0.3      4.0% highlights above v=0.5
#   mean value 0.153, mean saturation 0.565 — high chroma held dark
#   78.1% warm earth hue 20-80°          gold accent 0.6%
#   cool rim light 200-220° at 4.8%      (already correct in all four)
#
# NOT VERIFIED BY RENDER. Blender is not installed in this environment, so this
# has never been executed and no render has been scored against the checker.
# The geometry is derived from the reference crop by eye; the palette is derived
# from measurement. Whoever lands this must run:
#     blender --background --factory-startup --python tools/sprites-blender.py -- <out>
#     node asset-data/classes/check-look-conformance.mjs <out>/rogue_gold.webp
# and iterate the two materials until it passes. Treat the numbers as the gate,
# not this file.

# ---- materials to add beside the other module-level materials ---------------
# The 60-80° olive band is 10.2% of the reference and is what separates rogue's
# leather from reaver's all-steel 2.8%. Both stay dark on purpose: the approved
# look is high saturation at LOW value, so brightening these to read "green"
# breaks conformance even though the hue would be right.
