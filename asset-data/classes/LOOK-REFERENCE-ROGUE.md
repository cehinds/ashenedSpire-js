# AS-HD-040 — approved look reference: Rogue

**Owner ruling, 2026-09-02:** of the four frozen crops, only **rogue** carries the
approved look. **reaver, starseer and herald must be remodelled to match it.**

This supersedes the packet's recorded status. `SUCCESSOR-CONTRACT.md` §2 carried
the hub's *Proof Accepted · 20/20 gates · findings 0* for all four; that reading
is now known-wrong for three of them. See §4 below.

Verify with `node asset-data/classes/check-look-conformance.mjs`. The reference
envelope is re-measured from the pinned rogue blob on every run, so it cannot
drift away from the asset it describes.

## 1. The approved look, measured

From `8359517b` (rogue) at pin `62f6867a`, over pixels with alpha ≥ 200:

| trait | rogue | what it means |
|---|---|---|
| deep shadow, v<0.3 | **88.6 %** | the figure is overwhelmingly dark |
| highlights, v>0.5 | **4.0 %** | light is rare and earned |
| mean value | **0.153** | low-key throughout |
| mean saturation | **0.565** | high chroma, but crushed dark — rich, not bright; a candidate may lose at most 20 % of it |
| warm earth hue 20–80° | **78.1 %** | browns, olives, leather greens |
| gold accent | **0.6 %** | a clasp, not a costume |
| cool rim light 200–220° | **4.8 %** | the blue edge separating figure from ground |

**The look in one line:** deeply shadowed, richly saturated warm leather, lit by a
warm key and a cool rim, with gold used once.

The combination that matters is **high saturation with low value**. Turning the
brightness down on a gold-heavy design does not produce this; the hue family has
to change too.

## 2. How the other three miss

Ranked by distance from the approved look:

### starseer — 5 of 7 traits off (largest rework)
- **Hue family is wrong.** 13.0 % warm earth against rogue's 78.1 %; 61.9 % of the
  figure sits at 220–240° blue. This is a different palette, not a darker one.
- Too bright: 70.0 % deep shadow vs 88.6 %; mean value 0.264 vs 0.153.
- Rim light over-applied at 14.9 % vs 4.8 % — reads as blue body colour, not rim.
- Gold at 1.7 %, ~3× the reference.

### herald — 4 of 7 traits off
- **Brightest of the four**: 14.4 % highlights vs 4.0 %; mean value 0.274.
- **Gold at 3.7 %, ~6× the reference** — the halo and star sash are costume, not accent.
- Hue is flat: 80.9 % crammed into a single 20–40° band, where rogue spreads
  across 20–80° (41 % / 27 % / 10 %). Monotone rather than layered.
- Rim light already correct at 4.5 %.

### reaver — 3 of 7 traits off (closest)
- Too bright: 10.8 % highlights vs 4.0 %; mean value 0.215 vs 0.153.
- **Undersaturated**: 0.431 against the reference 0.565 — it loses 24 % of the
  chroma, past the 20 % the gate allows. Brightening is not the only gap.
- Hue family and gold restraint are already right (70.0 % warm earth, 0.8 % gold).
- Missing rogue's 60–80° olive band (2.8 % vs 10.2 %) — all steel, no leather.
- **Rim light already correct at 4.6 %.** The nearest of the three to conforming.

## 3. Already correct in all four — do not change

The cool rim light at 200–220° measures 4.5–4.8 % across every asset including
the reference. `tools/sprites-blender.py` names this convention in its header
("warm key + cool rim light"). It is the one thing the whole set agrees on.

## 4. What this ruling breaks

1. **`SUCCESSOR-CONTRACT.md` AC6 overstated its evidence.** It cited rogue-vs-reaver
   silhouette IoU 0.7052 as proof the Rogue/Reaver failure was fixed. Silhouette
   overlap cannot see a look mismatch: all four are upper-body torsos, so pairwise
   IoU sits in a narrow 0.6533–0.7990 band regardless of art direction. The
   original defect (rogue rendered from the Reaver rig) is genuinely gone, but IoU
   is not what shows it — the art differing is. AC6 should not be read as a look gate.
2. **The packet is not 4/4 approved.** Any downstream reading of *20/20 gates,
   findings 0* as covering the look of all four is wrong as of this ruling.

## 5. The blocker this exposes — no generator exists

`tools/sprites-blender.py` builds the class sprites procedurally in Blender. It
defines `build_reaver`, `build_starseer` and `build_herald`. Two facts follow:

- **There is no `build_rogue` anywhere in the repository.** `tools/equipment-blender.py:408`
  maps `"rogue": lib["build_reaver"]` — the original defect.
- **And it is duplicated.** `equipment-blender.py` holds a second class map
  (`CLASS_BUILD`, line 404) plus a `CLASS_BODY_MATS` entry (line 427) that
  repaints rogue through the Reaver's own materials. A builder added to the
  sprite renderer alone leaves every shipped `body_rogue_*.webp` on the Reaver
  rig.
- **The pipeline renders classes at 450×570 in WEBP.** (300×380 is the enemy
  size, and the module header comment is stale.) No file under `tools/` emits
  512×512, and none emits PNG.

So the four crops in this packet were **not produced by any pipeline in this
repository**, and the one asset the owner approved is the one with no builder at
all. Nobody can currently regenerate rogue — the approved look exists only as
80,807 bytes of PNG at blob `8359517b`.

This sharpens `SUCCESSOR-CONTRACT.md` §5.1 from a missing-paperwork item to a
reproducibility gap: per-file provenance is UNKNOWN *because the source is
outside the repository*, not because it went unrecorded.

**The pipeline covers exactly the three classes that need remodelling, and does
not cover the one that is correct.**

## 6. Scope note

Checked against `origin/dev`, not a stale clone:

- `.agentops/governance/git-ownership.json` assigns `tools/**` to
  **`owner_role: it-support`**, lane `support-tooling`.
- **No active writer lease claims `tools/**`.** `lease-AS-HD-057-it-support` is
  `revoked: true`; the live replacement `lease-AS-HD-057-it-support-r2` holds only
  `.agentops/work/AS-HD-057/**` and `.agentops/events/AS-HD-057/**`.
- This lease (`lease-AS-HD-040-maker`) holds `assets/classes/**` only.

So the path is unleased but role-owned, and this seat is `maker`, not
`it-support`. The same ownership row also reads: *"Repo tooling and support
scripts. Restores the ability to work; **product behaviour changes belong to
maker**."* A class look remodel is a product behaviour change living in a
support-owned path — the row points both ways at once.

That is technical ambiguity over a shared path, which art.md §4 reserves to the
IT Manager III. See `TOOLS-ACCESS-REQUEST.md`.

What this seat can supply, and has: the measured target, the ranked deltas, a
checker that gates any candidate against the approved look, and a drafted
builder for the missing class — `build_rogue.proposal.py`, written against the
host module's own idiom for whoever holds `tools/**` to paste in.

**`build_rogue.proposal.py` has never been rendered.** Blender is not installed
in this environment. What was checked: it compiles, all 17 symbols it borrows
from `tools/sprites-blender.py` exist there, it passes no unknown keyword
arguments, and every primitive it calls is one the host already uses. What was
*not* checked: whether the render it produces conforms. Whoever lands it must
render and score it, and iterate the two new materials until the checker passes.
The measured envelope in §1 is the gate — not the geometry in that file.

One design tension it cannot settle: every other class carries a broad
`ACCENT_CLOTH` sweep so "the silhouette that glows is always yours", but the
approved look measures gold at 0.6 %. The proposal keeps the accent as a narrow
mantle edge plus a throat clasp. Whether the hero-accent convention outranks the
approved look is an IT Manager III call.

## 7. Reproducing

```
node asset-data/classes/check-look-conformance.mjs                # all four vs rogue
node asset-data/classes/check-look-conformance.mjs cand.png       # score a candidate
node asset-data/classes/check-look-conformance.mjs --selftest     # replay known attacks
```
After landing `build_rogue` in `tools/sprites-blender.py`:
```
blender --background --factory-startup --python tools/sprites-blender.py -- <out>
node asset-data/classes/check-look-conformance.mjs <out>/rogue_gold.webp
```
The renderer emits **WEBP**, so the checker converts it before profiling, using
whichever of `dwebp`, `ffmpeg`, `magick` or `convert` is installed. With none of
them it stops and names the conversion command rather than failing obscurely.

### The nine traits

**Seven are colour statistics.** Five are fixed tolerances; **mean saturation is
derived from the reference** — a candidate may lose at most 20 % of its chroma —
because the approved look is high chroma held at low value, and value plus hue
alone do not pin that. Pulling every pixel toward its own grey preserves each
value bucket and each hue bucket exactly, so without that trait a candidate at
0.205 saturation against 0.565, with every gold pixel gone, scored `ALL CONFORM`.

**Two are structural**, because a histogram cannot see a picture. Shuffling the
RGB among the opaque pixels while keeping the alpha mask preserves all seven
colour traits *bit for bit* — Δ0.0 on every row — for an image that is visual
noise.

| trait | rule | rogue | reaver | starseer | herald | shuffled |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| local coherence | ≤ 2× the reference | 0.0279 | 0.0291 | 0.0224 | 0.0312 | **0.1521** |
| rim on the silhouette | ≥ 1.80× enrichment | 5.31× | 2.93× | 1.99× | 2.63× | **1.08×** |

*Local coherence* is the mean value difference between adjacent opaque pixels:
rendered art is locally smooth, noise is not. *Rim enrichment* is how much more
often the 200–220° rim hue falls in the 6 px band along the silhouette than a
random placement would put it; 1.0× means no structure at all, which is what a
shuffle produces however much rim hue survives.

Both are one-sided — a floor and a ceiling on structure, not a resemblance to
the reference's exact number — and all four real assets clear both, so they
discriminate art from corruption without adding failures to the ruling.

### Self-test

`--selftest` synthesises both attacks in memory from the reference and asserts
each is caught:

```
node asset-data/classes/check-look-conformance.mjs --selftest
  → SELFTEST OK: all 2 negative plants correctly caught.
```

Both once scored `ALL CONFORM`. They are kept as tests so those holes cannot
silently reopen — verified by weakening the two structural bounds, which turns
the run into `SELFTEST FAILED: 1 plant(s) scored as conforming.`
Exit code is 0 only when every scored asset conforms.
