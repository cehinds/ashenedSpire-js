# Player polish design QA

Final result: blocked. The owner rejected this implementation. The previous
captures established route reachability; they did not demonstrate fidelity or
live effects. They forced reduced motion, while default high contrast removed
the supplied frames. All acceptance claims below are withdrawn for this
experimental iteration. Both publication PRs are drafts; do not merge.

Reference: the twelve approved boards in `docs/design/player-polish-2026-10-01`
and the reviewed asset kit in `docs/design/player-polish-asset-kit-2026-10-02`.
The 24 runtime recipes and canonical grounding are recorded in
`docs/PLAYER-POLISH-RUNTIME.md`.

Actual built light edition inspected in Chromium at 1280×800, 390×844 and
844×390. Screen captures use the supported reduced-motion setting and the
existing memory-only showcase routes. The route matrix covers title, creation,
opening, dialogue, journey, classic map, dungeon, combat, boss introduction,
merchant, smith, master, rest, rewards, compendium, co-op fight/route votes,
lobby, results, history, settings, profile, custom run and one-off events.
Actual UI navigation also covered Crownfall, Armoury equipment/character/
progression/inventory/comparison, deck editing, card expansion, relic and
flask detail, and custom-run draft picks. No campaign-completion or network
multiplayer-session claim is made by these screenshots.

The captured route checks found no outer document overflow or broken visible
images; captured browser warning/error log was empty. The screenshots were
compared with all twelve boards, including full-size portrait and short-wide
inspection where miniature contact sheets exposed crowding.

Resolved findings: opaque button texture hid semantic fills; generic sprite
framing drew black boxes around canonical combatants; a meter selector painted
empty tracks; smith rows clipped offer names/actions; portrait service totals
crushed the heading; stacked compendium tiles clipped names/art; short-wide
title clipped its final entries and long labels. Final presentation preserves
native primary/selection/exit/disabled colours and End Turn's exception,
canonical actor/map/floor anchors, unknown compendium art, actual ownership,
prerequisites, prices, consequences and recovery caps. High contrast keeps
solid information surfaces. There are no outstanding P0/P1/P2 presentation
findings from this inspection.

Committed proof: `docs/preview/player-polish-runtime/`. Full captures, DOM
snapshots and route measurements are local review evidence under
`D:/repos/.codex/visualizations/2026/10/02/player-polish-runtime/screenshots`.
Engine/tool/CI validation is reported separately in the PR; design QA is not
a substitute for those gates.
