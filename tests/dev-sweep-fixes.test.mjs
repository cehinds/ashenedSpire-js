// tests/dev-sweep-fixes.test.mjs — the four dev defects reported with evidence
// on #999, which was closed without merging. Each check pins the FIX, and each
// one fails on the code as it stood:
//
//   1. tools/balance.mjs graded every encounter in the game as Act 1, because
//      it read `enc.act` and the seat refactor removed that field.
//   2. the co-op snapshot never carried the seat, so every co-op fight header
//      and map title said a bare "ACT II" where solo names the seat.
//   3. the co-op snapshot never carried `performedMoves`, so a client's
//      "Previous actions" read `unknown` — not "nothing yet" — forever.
//   4. Save and Quit stayed live through the victory hand-off, so a save could
//      checkpoint a combat that had already ended: a slot that resumes into a
//      won fight nothing will ever end.
//
// (The fifth, card.js dropping the ◆ on a zero-cost card, is pinned where it
// belongs — tests/wireframe-card.test.mjs, which used to assert the defect.)
//
// BOUNDARY: these are model, tool and source-contract checks. What a co-op
// client PAINTS is the browser gates; this says the field is sent and read.
