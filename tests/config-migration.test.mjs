// tests/config-migration.test.mjs — the JS config tables that moved into
// content/config/ui/presentation/, and the shims left in their place.
//
// TWO CLAIMS, AND THEY ARE DIFFERENT CLAIMS:
//
//   1. NOTHING MOVED BUT THE HOME. tests/fixtures/config-migration-baseline
//      .json was captured by tests/capture-config-baseline.mjs running on dev
//      BEFORE any shim existed, so it records what the hand-written modules
//      actually exported. Every module is re-transcribed here and held to it —
//      values, types, KEY ORDER, and the results of the functions that read the
//      tables. Key order is in the contract because consumers iterate these:
//      legendEntries walks NODE_TYPES, menuRows walks the band order, so a JSON
//      round-trip that reordered keys would change a screen while every value
//      stayed equal.
//
//   2. THE SHIMS AUTHOR NO NUMBER. A shim that quietly keeps one literal is the
//      second copy the move exists to delete, and it is invisible — the values
//      still agree on the day it is written. Same shape as the wireframeUi
//      guard in tests/ui-config.test.mjs.
//
// NOTHING IS ALLOWED TO DIFFER, including how deeply a table is frozen. The
// compiled config is deep-frozen; several of these tables were shallow-frozen
// or not frozen at all, so the shims hand out copies shaped to match — see
// src/config/authored.js. That is not fussiness. tools/surfaces.mjs's known-bad
// corpus plants each defect by mutating ONE table in memory, "exactly the way
// an author would by hand", and against a deep-frozen MENU_TABS that plant
// raises a TypeError instead of the red it exists to produce. A migration that
// changes what a consumer may do with what it is handed has not kept the
// consumer, however much safer the new rule sounds.

// RE-POINTING A BASELINE VALUE, AND THE ONLY REASON THAT IS ALLOWED. These
// fixtures pin what each module exported BEFORE its tables moved into
// content/config, so a red here normally means the move changed behaviour and
// the MODULE is wrong. There is one other case: an authored value legitimately
// changes AFTER the baseline was captured, and then the FIXTURE is the stale
// one. Re-point it by hand, one value, never by regenerating the file — a
// regeneration would relabel every other drift as intended at the same time.
//
// Re-pointed so far:
//   · CombatLayout.minimumHandHeight([]) 161.6 -> 145.6, for #1146, which gave
//     the playing card one authored shape and moved its ratio from 5/8 to 5/7.
//     The hand's floor is minWidthRem * rem / card.ratio + the inset, lift and
//     arc, so a wider card needs less height: 80/0.625 + 33.6 = 161.6 became
//     80/(5/7) + 33.6 = 145.6. #1146 and #1140 merged 74 seconds apart, so
//     neither could see the other's effect and dev went red on the pair.
//   · tooltipHelp.messages.playerPoise. #1203 gave the player a live Poise
//     meter with a Constitution term, so the old copy denied a feature that
//     exists and named three of the four things that steady the threshold.
//     One string, re-pointed by hand.
//   · CombatFormationModel probes now include #1180's grid cells, rowSpacing,
//     cell labels and fitGround. Its slots keep their previous coordinates;
//     only that module's entry is refreshed for the approved added outputs.
//   · StartupGateModels' TITLE_ENTRANCE_TIMING.holdDefault is 2s, not 0.5s:
//     the owner's uploaded defaults (#1254) set the city title pause. Only that
//     one value is refreshed.
