  // WHY IT IS RUN HERE AND NOT BY A PERSON. `release-shots.mjs` did not start
  // for a whole day. Four gates missed it, and the reason is one sentence:
  // every one of them ran this suite, and that file is in nobody's suite — its
  // first run would have been at upload, by whoever was tired. A census that
  // reports the project's state to Constantine goes into exactly that category
  // the moment it exists, so it is wired in on the day it is written rather
  // than on the day it is missed.
  //
  // It CAN be, and that is the whole difference — no browser, no bundle, no
  // port. It is a join between the screens directory, the import graph and the
  // instrument sources. release-shots needs a built artifact and a browser and
  // therefore still needs Bjorn's answer; this is not that answer and does not
  // pretend to be one.
  //
  // Two lines for the same reason 36/37 and 39/40 are two: 41 is the CENSUS'S
  // OWN integrity — its whole known-bad corpus, including the both-edges plant
  // where a fully watched tree must stop alarming. Its failure is the check's
  // fault. 42 is the state of src/.
  //
  // THIS COMMENT USED TO SAY "42's failure is the code's" AND THAT WAS NOT TRUE.
  // Vira measured it while gating this pair: a census that cannot read one of
  // its homes, and the per-row `unreadable` floor, both land on 42 — so the slot
  // labelled for a defect in the game was also catching defects in the check.
  // The exit codes now carry as much of the split as they honestly can, and this
  // is what they actually implement:
  //
  //   42 red, exit 2 — the census could not be taken. A home stopped being
  //                    readable. THE CHECK'S FAULT, or the tree's, never the
  //                    game's; no counts are printed at all.
  //   42 red, exit 1 — a finding. Usually the game's (a screen nothing in src/
  //                    imports), sometimes still the census's (a module it can
  //                    derive no way to recognise). THE FINDING LINE NAMES ITS
  //                    OWNER, and that is the part a reader must use.
  //
  // The residue is deliberate and stated rather than smoothed: one exit code
  // cannot carry a distinction the findings list makes per row.
  //
  // NO PLANT COUNT HERE. This comment said "seven plants" and the corpus is now
  // larger; a count typed beside a list that lives in another file is the same
  // second-home defect this pair exists to catch, and it went stale the first
  // time the corpus grew. The tool's own RESULT line prints the count.
  //
  // NO COUNT IN THIS COMMENT, deliberately — the tool's RESULT line carries
  // every number with the ref it was counted at, and 42 quotes it whole. A
  // number typed beside the thing that owns it is what the census exists to
  // kill, and the top of commons/release-floor.md is why we know that.
  //
  // AND 42 PASSES WHILE SCREENS SIT UNWATCHED, on purpose. The exit code is
  // the health of the DERIVATION — a home that stopped being readable, a screen
  // nothing can mount. How many screens nobody watches is the state of the
  // project, and whether that is fit to ship is Sten's judgement against his
  // datum, not this suite's. The number is printed on every run so it cannot

  // 67/68 — DOES A GATE ACTUALLY RUN ITS INSTRUMENTS, AND DOES IT LISTEN?
  //
  // Same two-line shape as every pair above, and here for a measured reason.
  //
  // #295: `tools/hintstrip.mjs` was red for four days while PR #224 passed
  // exact-head review, because the instrument that contradicted it was in no
  // list any gate walks. The gate command set in this house is derived BY HAND
  // (SOP 14 §5a), and on 2026-08-21 two experienced hands derived it wrongly in
  // opposite directions inside one hour — a grep cannot tell `run:` from `echo`.
  //
  // ⚠ AND THE HALF THAT PUT IT IN *THIS* FILE RATHER THAN THE WORKFLOW, WHICH IS
  // VIRA'S FINDING. Wiring an instrument into `ci.yml` is not enough. I claimed
  // hintstrip's two steps were a redundant pair, having planted `|| true` on the
  // first and watched the job stay red. The selftest's clean edge IS the first
  // step re-run, so the job stayed red because THE SAME CHECK FAILED TWICE — and
  // the day the tree goes green, `|| true` on that step silences the gate with
  // no signal at all. The redundancy evaporates at exactly the moment it would
  // matter, because a green tree is the only state in which a regression can be
  // introduced. `gatelist --selftest` plants that `|| true` and requires G4 red,
  // and THIS suite runs on a green tree, at every gate, with no dispatch.
  //
  // IT BELONGS HERE AND NOT IN ci.yml: it opens no browser, needs no port and no
  // build — it reads the declared lists and parses them. This file's BOUNDARY
  // block below is therefore still true, and 59 is the first check in this suite
  // that is about the GATE rather than about the game.
  //
  // NUMBERED 67/68, AND IT TOOK ME FOUR TRIES, WHICH IS THE POINT AND IS NOW
  // ALSO THE ANSWER. My first wiring used 58/59 and printed "58." and "59."
  // TWICE in one run — engine.test.js owns those (nearestShrine, the shrine
  // glow). I moved to 60/61 and COLLIDED AGAIN, for the same reason. I then took
  // 62/63, which dev had explicitly reserved for this PR in the note beside
  // 64/65 — and on the replay onto 456b8ea IT COLLIDED A THIRD TIME, because
  // engine.test.js had meanwhile grown a 62 of its own. A reservation written in
  // one file is not a reservation; it is a request the other file never read.
  //
  // THE HAZARD I CALLED "STRUCTURAL AND STILL OPEN" IS NOW CLOSED, AND NOT BY
  // ME. tools/testnumbers.mjs (64/65, dev) is the check I said was owed and did
  // not build. It is what caught this third collision — I did not notice it, the
  // gate did — and 67 is DERIVED FROM ITS OUTPUT ("the next free number is 67"),
  // not read off a file by hand and not remembered. That is the whole argument
  // for wiring an instrument into a list: the two tries above cost a reviewer's
  // attention, and this one cost nothing.

  // check's fault. 63 is the state of the lists. NO PLANT COUNT AND NO TOOL

  // merge cannot see." It was a warning with no check behind it, and dev printed
