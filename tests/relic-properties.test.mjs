// tests/relic-properties.test.mjs — the relic→property migration's snapshot
// (docs/plan-progression-and-property-system.md phase 2).
//
// WHY A FILE OF ITS OWN rather than a case in engine.test.js: the claim this
// makes is byte-identity against a RECORDED fixture, and the fixture is a file.
// engine.test.js runs in the browser too (tests/index.html), where there is no
// readFileSync and a JSON import is a different module grammar. The behavioural
// half of phase 2 — that a relic still fires, once, through the mount path —
// belongs in the engine suite and is asserted there; this owns the half that
// needs a disk read.
//
// WHAT THE FIXTURE IS: every shipped relic's rendered sentence, captured on
// `dev` at 0.7.1.57, BEFORE the relics' triggers moved into propertyRules. A
// relic's numbers are derived from the entries that produce them, and phase 2
// moved half of those entries to another table — so "the sentence did not
// change" is exactly the claim a reader wants and exactly the one a refactor of
// this shape can break without any test noticing.
//
// WHEN A RELIC IS DELIBERATELY RETUNED, the fixture is re-recorded in the same
// pull request that retunes it, and the diff on this file is the receipt for
// what the player will read differently. Regenerating it to make a red go away
// is the one use it does not have.
