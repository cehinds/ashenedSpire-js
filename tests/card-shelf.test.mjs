// tests/card-shelf.test.mjs — A SHELF OF RESTING CARDS HOLDS FOUR, AND SAYS SO.
//
// THE COMPLAINT THIS ANSWERS, in the owner's words (2026-09-20, with a
// photograph of the merchant at 1328x744): "why do these cards have background
// containers and why aren't they in glance view so that I can see four cards
// at a time without scrolling?"
//
// Both halves were true and neither was a card-renderer bug. The cards WERE at
// the glance width; what stood around them was a 280px OptionCard — the FOCUS
// width — and what laid them out was `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(0, 280px))`. In
// a 631px offers column that is two tracks, so a three-armament shelf wrapped
// to two rows and the third went behind a scroll, each card sitting in 128px
// of empty panel. Five shop shelves, five different layout rules, and not one
// number anywhere that said how many cards a row is meant to hold.
//
// So there is a number now, authored once at
// `content/config/ui/components/card.json -> sizing.shelf`, and this file asks
// it the questions that a stylesheet cannot be asked from Node:
//
//   A  THE COUNT IS THE CSS'S COUNT. `.card-shelf` is a wrapping flex row
//      whose items take `flex-basis: max(floor, track)`; the browser fits
//      `floor((W + gap) / (basis + gap))` per row. `cardShelfColumnsAt` is
//      that arithmetic, so the model and the stylesheet cannot drift into two
//      answers about the same shelf. Measured against the real thing in
//      headless Chromium (see the PR body); reproduced here so a change to the
//      numbers is caught in a millisecond rather than in a screenshot.
//
//   B  THE FLOOR IS A FLOOR, NOT A SIZE. Below the width four cards need, the
//      shelf drops a column — it never shaves cards to fit, because cards you
//      cannot read are the complaint, not the fix. Above it, the track is used
//      in full up to the resting width and never past it.
//
//   C  THE FLOOR CANNOT STAND ABOVE THE CARD IT FLOORS. The resting width is
//      tunable at runtime and is the phone's own variant below the compact
//      threshold; either can take it under the authored floor, and a floor
//      above the card would stretch every shelf item past its own face — the
//      empty-panel defect, restated as a number.
//
//   D  THE MERCHANT'S OFFERS COLUMN ASKS FOR A SHELF, NOT A FRACTION. Half the
//      pane was 490px at the photographed shape and a shelf of four resting
//      cards needs 644. The fraction is a floor now, and the detail column's
//      own authored minimum is the bound.
