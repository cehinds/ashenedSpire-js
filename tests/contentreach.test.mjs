//
// THE TREE IS RED TODAY, AND THIS FILE SAYS SO EXACTLY. The first run of the
// tool found the orphans pinned below. They are findings, not fixes: content is
// not this change's to edit, and none has been ruled intentionally unobtainable
// by the owner, so none is on the tool's ALLOWED_UNREACHABLE list. The pin is a
// ratchet in BOTH directions — a new orphan fails here, and so does a pinned
// one that gains a route (delete its line in the same change, so the freed
// slack cannot hide the next one). When the list is empty, the tool exits 0
// and the assertion below flips to demand exactly that.
