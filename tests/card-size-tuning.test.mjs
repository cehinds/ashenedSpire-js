// tests/card-size-tuning.test.mjs — the tunable card-size table, and the three
// promises it makes to the person tuning it.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, STATED PLAINLY. The card-size feature took TWENTY-NINE
// review findings, and not one of them came from a gate. Every one was found by
// a human or a review bot reading the diff. Several came in runs where the fix
// for one defect introduced the next — the ladder guard that skipped its own
// variants, the clamp that disagreed with the control it was meant to agree
// with, the threshold that measured the window instead of the door, the
// rounding that showed 200 and drew 201. Each was a pure function with no DOM
// in it, reachable in a millisecond from Node, and each survived because
// nothing here asked it a question.
//
// (This file was written at sixteen and the count kept climbing after it. The
// number is updated rather than left as a smaller, kinder one, because a stale
// figure in a comment is exactly the sort of thing this PR kept having to
// correct elsewhere.)
//
// So these are the questions. They are not a claim that the feature works —
// geometry is measured in a browser by tools/card-one-shape.mjs and
// tools/character-creation-check.mjs, and this file cannot see a pixel. They
// are the arithmetic underneath it, where the defects actually lived.
//
// THREE PROPERTIES:
//
//   A  THE LADDER IS REFUSED WHOLE, INCLUDING ITS VARIANTS. `glance < focus <
//      inspect` is the promise that a card you opened to read is never smaller
//      than one you were browsing past. The first version checked only
//      `glance.widthPx` and let `glance.variants.mobile` — the width a PHONE
//      actually rests at — sail past. A refusal must also be a refusal of the
//      WHOLE table, not a partial merge: half-applied sizes are worse than none,
//      because they look deliberate.
//
//   B  WHAT THE CONTROL SHOWS IS WHAT THE LAYOUT DRAWS. These were two
//      normalisations, and they differed twice: a floor against a round (200.9
//      shown as 200, applied as 201) and a clamp against a fallback (a negative
//      shown as the 64px minimum, drawn at the authored width). A tuner that
//      lies about the number it is using is worse than one that refuses.
//
//   C  THE EXPORT IS PASTEABLE AT THE PATH IT NAMES. Its whole purpose is to
//      leave this machine and become a default. It has been wrong in both
//      directions — a bare `{levels}` that left no `sizing` block, then the
//      right nesting with an instruction that would have produced
//      `sizing.levels.sizing.levels`.
