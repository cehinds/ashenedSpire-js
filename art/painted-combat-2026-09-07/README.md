# Painted character art preview

Prepared 2026-09-07 on `codex/painted-combat-frames`.

The current request separates character presentation from combat animation. Keep the previously approved artwork, including the close-up portraits. Character menu and detail poses may face the viewer. Combat uses a small set of poses directed toward screen right.

## Contents

All four classes have their base outfit and three alternatives: 16 outfits total.

- `menu/<outfit>/stand.png` and `detail.png`: 32 full-body presentation images, 640 x 800.
- `menu/<outfit>/portrait.png`: 16 matching close-ups, 512 x 512.
- `combat/<outfit>/`: seven 640 x 640 RGBA state files per outfit, 112 files total: idle, guard, attack1, attack2, attack3, attack4, hit.
- `manifest.json`: image paths, source sheet and pose, content bounds, and the common combat anchor [320, 600].
- `library.json`: 47 retained source sheets, including older poses outside the compact combat set and the facing corrections. No source art is replaced by its corrected derivative.
- `inspection/`: browser contact sheets, phone screenshot, automated results and visual review notes.

Rogue and Starseer share their guard drawing with combat idle: six distinct combat drawings mapped to seven states. Herald has a separate idle drawing. The owner specifically selected the existing upright, sword-point-down pose as Reaver combat idle, retaining its presentation angle. Base, Vigil and Warden reuse their menu stand; Oathsworn uses the hands-on-sword pose in the first cell of its preserved expanded sheet. All four Reaver outfits now use attack 1 low advance, attack 2 overhead windup and attack 3 downward cleave, with the three attacks facing right. Guard, recovery, hit and portraits retain their prior selections. These are compact keyframe sequences, not fully in-betweened animations. `reaver-selected-attacks.json` records the pose request and generation provenance.

## Review and rebuild

From this worktree root:

```powershell
node art/painted-combat-2026-09-07/serve.mjs
```

Each class now has one complete page containing all four outfits, their menu/detail poses, portraits, combat poses and every retained source sheet:

- Reaver: <http://127.0.0.1:4276/reaver.html>
- Rogue: <http://127.0.0.1:4276/rogue.html>
- Starseer: <http://127.0.0.1:4276/starseer.html>
- Herald: <http://127.0.0.1:4276/herald.html>

The comparison tools and animation player remain at <http://127.0.0.1:4276/>. Playback supports pause, frame stepping and slower speeds. Rebuild just the class pages with `node art/painted-combat-2026-09-07/build-pages.mjs`; the full asset build also regenerates them.

```powershell
node art/painted-combat-2026-09-07/build.mjs
```

The build uses this repository's `tools/painted-poses.mjs` and `tools/concept-cutout.mjs` to extract, align and export the images. Intermediate extraction directories are ignored. An optional outfit ID limits the rebuild, for example `node art/painted-combat-2026-09-07/build.mjs rogue-duelist`.

With the preview server running and Playwright available:

```powershell
$env:NODE_PATH = 'C:/Users/suprbludude/.cache/codex-runtimes/codex-primary-runtime/dependencies/node/node_modules'
node art/painted-combat-2026-09-07/inspect.mjs
```

The checker verifies the 112 combat files, dimensions, margins, baseline alignment, menu files, browser frame decoding and phone overflow. Facing direction and drawing quality require visual inspection; passing the checker alone does not establish either.

## Provenance and status

New paintings were generated with built-in `image_gen`, using the owner's attached armor and pose references. `generation-record.json` and `duelist-correction-record.json` record the latest prompts and output paths. `prompts.json` records the earlier expanded-frame proposal, which the compact scope in `requirements.json` supersedes. Original sheets are preserved in `reference-library/`, `sheets/`, `menu-sheets/` and `combat-sheets/`.

This package contains inspected artwork and standalone preview pages. It does not install the images in the game or change gameplay or shared UI files. Game integration remains separate work and needs to account for the latest Armoury UI changes. Standalone preview validation is recorded under `inspection/`; branch promotion and repository checks are recorded on its GitHub pull requests. In-game validation has not been performed for this package.

Reaver full-body menu and detail images use the same approved upright, hands-on-hilt sword-rest stance across all four outfits. Close-up portraits remain unchanged; earlier poses remain in the source library.

Reaver close-up portraits follow the selected Warden bust pose: upright helmet angled slightly right, both shoulders visible, chest-up crop. Three replacement portrait sources are retained in portrait-sources; Warden retains the approved original.

Game integration: tools/painted-outfits-ship.mjs exports the approved assets to assets/painted-outfits and generates src/content/paintedOutfits.js. Class selection uses portraits, character customization uses detail images, and the armory uses menu stand images and menu-pose armor thumbnails. Animated combat uses the seven authored states. Run tools/painted-outfits-check.mjs against the game server on port 4277 to verify all 160 image decodes, playback and screen integration.

Armor item art uses src/model/paintedOutfitArt.js on character-creation cards, armory equipment/details, smithing and mounting screens. All sixteen existing outfits resolve to their full-body menu pose; class-selection portraits and character-customization detail poses remain separate.
