# Greatsword outfit animation suite

Open `index.html` for synchronized playback across all four classes and 35 armor entries (32 distinct appearances). Filter by class, select an action, pause, or scrub the nine-step attack. Every entry has a portrait and labeled pose sheet. Copied references include the armor ID, playback step and original pose ID.

The approved motion is ready → source ATK-07 → ATK-04 → ATK-02 → ATK-03 → ATK-05 → ATK-01 → ATK-04 → ready. Preview labels ATK-01 through ATK-07 refer to these seven playback steps, not source filenames. The repeated source ATK-04 is intentional. Source ATK-06 remains available in the exported suite but is not part of the approved attack.

Thirty-one new full-suite atlases were generated with the built-in image_gen tool using the approved Reaver atlas as the pose/layout reference and each shipped outfit's menu image as its appearance reference. The original approved Reaver frames are reused unchanged. Exact prompts are saved in `prompts.json`; generated PNG masters remain in `sources/`. No external artwork was downloaded.

Each unique appearance supplies 14 transparent poses plus a portrait. `export.py` slices the 4×4 source grid, applies one scale per full-body suite and a common bottom-center foot anchor, writes 512×512 WebPs, and verifies decoded alpha byte-for-byte. Animated previews and labeled sheets use the approved playback order. Generated anatomy and cloth are painted approximations, not a skeletal rig.

Run `python art/greatsword-outfits-2026-09-19/export.py --bind` from the repository with Pillow installed, then `node tools/config-build.mjs`. Binding refuses to run until all 32 appearances exist. Runtime files live under `assets/animations/greatsword-outfits/`.

All armor bindings reference one `greatswordTwoHand` motion profile. Bastion Harness reuses Warden Mail, Rimeweave Robes reuse Starlit Silks, and Waywatcher Coat reuses Nightveil Coat, matching the catalog aliases. Shared Wayfarer Plate, Nightweave, Rite Vestments and Gutter Leathers each have a dedicated appearance for every class; their legacy art aliases do not replace those paintings. Both ordered empty-hand/greatsword combinations are covered. Existing catalog greatswords report the legacy one-hand grip when held alone; their visual motion remains two-handed without changing equipment mechanics. An occupied second hand prevents this animation selection.
