 * Constantine asked for a 30-minute run, and the thing that drives run length is
 * how many nodes he has to stop on. He cannot be handed a knob and a promise —
 * he has to be handed the number, and it has to move while he drags. So this is
 * the ONE sampler: the Custom Climb screen prints it live, tools/mapplan.mjs
 * prints it in the before/after table, and the tests assert on it. Three readers,
 * one measurement, so a screen can never quote a figure the tool disagrees with.
 *
 * Seeds come from `sweepSeed` (engine/rng.js) for the reason written there: a
 * sweep whose seeds all collapse to 0 prints a perfect distribution of one graph.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT: wall-clock. Nobody in this tree can measure minutes. Node count

 * question `tools/mapplan.mjs` and the tests ask it: is there an Elite with no
 * Shrine on any earlier floor? `resolveFloorPlan` refuses at boot the one
