// src/engine/save.js — run persistence with schema + content versioning
// (SPEC §3.12)
//
// Storage is injected so the module stays headless: the UI passes
// window.localStorage; tests pass a plain in-memory stub with the same
// getItem/setItem/removeItem shape. Saves that can't be trusted (unknown
// schemaVersion, corrupt JSON, dangling content ids after a content change)
// are ARCHIVED — moved aside, never silently deleted — and load returns null.
//
// PROFILE DURABILITY (#67). The meta record is the durable one: settings, run
// results, and the progress tally the unlocks are earned from — the thing that
// will hold a 2000-run character. It used to be treated as a cache while runs
// were treated as precious, forty lines apart in this file. Five properties now
// hold for it, and each one is a check in tools/profile-durability-probe.mjs:
//
//   1. schemaVersion is WRITTEN AND READ. Older: migrated, or refused BY NAME.
//      Newer: refused AND PRESERVED — an older build must never eat a profile
//      a newer build wrote.
//   2. Archives are KEYED and APPENDED, never overwritten — the second loss
//      must not erase the first.
//   3. A failed load is a NAMED, VISIBLE state (profileStatus()), never a fresh
//      profile wearing the same filename.
//   4. While a profile is unreadable the manager is QUARANTINED: no write may
//      overwrite the original bytes, because those bytes are the evidence for
//      every other failure.
//   5. The drawer has a HANDLE: listArchives / getArchive / exportArchive /
//      restoreProfile — preservation the player cannot reach is a kinder word
//      for lost.

  // walks the gap. First startNewProfile (Vira's D1), then restoreProfile
  // (Sunna's D12) — which destroyed the outgoing profile while its dialog
  // promised it would be "set aside here in its place".
  //
  // So the rule stops being prose. Any code that replaces the live profile
  // calls THIS, and archiving is not a step a caller can forget because it is
  // not a caller's step. A new path that writes META_KEY directly is a defect
  // findable by grep: this and saveMeta are the only two writers, and saveMeta
  // never replaces a DIFFERENT profile — it updates the one already live.

  // ---- THE PROFILE EXISTS BEFORE THE FIRST RUN DOES (M7) -------------------
  // His ask: "profile should be able to be created before first run, not after".
  // What shipped did the opposite. `loadMeta()` SYNTHESIZES a profile in memory
  // for every caller (freshMeta) and writes nothing, so a player who cleared
  // storage, picked a class and pressed BEGIN THE CLIMB had `sote_run_v1` and no
  // `sote_meta_v1` — a run with no player behind it — and Title → Profile
  // printed his own sentence back at him as the behaviour (Bjorn's M7 walk,
  // 2026-08-08). Two states for one concept: the profile that exists because
  // every read gets an object, and the profile that exists on disk.
  //
  // This is the collapse. `ensureProfile()` is the only way a profile comes into
  // being unasked, it is idempotent, and it never touches one that is already
  // there. It is called at two places and they are one rule each:
  //
  //   · at the class-pick commit (main.js newRun) — HIS ask, and it lands
  //     BEFORE the run is created, so the profile is older than the climb.
  //   · inside saveRun/loadRun below — A STORED RUN IMPLIES A STORED PROFILE.
  //     That is the structural half: it cannot be forgotten by a future start
  //     path the way the first one was, and it is what repairs the players who
  //     ALREADY have runs and no profile, with no migration to write.
