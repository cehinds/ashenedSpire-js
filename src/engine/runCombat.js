// engine/runCombat.js — the one door a run's fight is built through.
//
// The live game (src/main.js enterCombat) and every headless simulator
// (tools/runsim.mjs, tools/balance.mjs, tools/measure-classes.mjs) build a
// fight from a run here, so a simulated fight is the fight a player gets: the
// same hand rules, rating rules, swap price, equipment start statuses and
// stamped pools. Before this door each simulator kept its own copy of the
// option list, and the copies had drifted — none passed the hand or rating
// rules, so the bots were measuring a game nobody played.
//
// runCombatEnd(run, combat) is the matching exit: the pools a fight leaves
// behind (HP, Mana, Stamina and their maxima, flasks and their charges, the
// equipment pool deficits) are written back to the run, as the live
// onCombatEnd does, so the next fight opens where this one ended.
