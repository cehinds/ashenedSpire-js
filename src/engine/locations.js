// src/engine/locations.js — the location visit: a place's rules mounted from
// arrival to departure (plan phase 7, proposal §7.4)
//
// The classic shrine used to be two helpers and a screen that knew the
// numbers: `shrineHealAmount` (35% × a relic multiplier), `applyGraceRefill`
// called on arrival, and `run.mana = run.maxMana` written by the Rest button.
// A town, a chapel or a camp would each have been another helper. Now a
// location is a CARRIER (model/locations.js): its tags' rules mount on the
// run-level context, `arrived` is emitted when the run reaches it and
// `rested` when the player takes its Rest, and the pools move through the
// same opcode bodies a fight uses (heal, restoreMana, refillFlasks). What a
// place restores is the sum of its tags — content, not code.
//
// THE VISIT IS THE WINDOW. createLocationVisit mounts; leaveLocation
// unmounts. Between them the run may pass through other doors (a level
// point assigned, a flask charge moved), so every emission re-reads the run
// into the facade first (syncRunContext) and writes back after the queue
// drains. previewRest runs the same rules on a clone, so the screen's
// "Heal N HP" line and the button that heals read one answer.
//
// Headless: no document/window/localStorage/timers.
