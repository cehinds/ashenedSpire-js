// src/services/cardActions.js — the only answer to "what can I do with this
// card, on this surface, right now?"
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Until now that question had no home, and the shape of
// its absence was a default: `card.js` handed every inspect door
// `() => ({ enabled: false, reason: 'Play cards from your combat hand.' })`,
// and exactly ONE call site in the whole tree overrode it (combat.js). So the
// spoils screen, the merchant, the draft, the Smith and the compendium all
// opened a card and offered a dead button wearing combat's verb — on the
// spoils screen, the one surface where the player had come specifically to
// TAKE the card they were reading.
//
// A default is what a missing abstraction looks like from the inside. It is
// always SOME surface's answer, frozen and served to every other surface.
//
// THE LAYER, STATED SO IT IS DECLARED RATHER THAN SMUGGLED. This is a
// SERVICE in the sense docs/COMPONENT-MODEL-ARCHITECTURE.md means: pure,
// headless, DOM-free, no mutation. It sits between the domain (src/model,
// src/engine) and the presentation layers, and it answers questions — it does
// not perform. The existing contract's table has no row for it because until
// now nothing needed one; the row is added in that document by the same
// change that adds this file.
//
// WHAT IT RETURNS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT.
//
//   IT RETURNS: which verbs a surface offers for a card, whether each is
//   available, and the sentence explaining a refusal.
//
//   IT DOES NOT RETURN CALLBACKS. This is the same rule `behaviorModel`
//   already holds every Component Model to — a record names an interaction,
//   it never carries the function. So an action here is `{ id, verb, enabled,
//   reason }` and the screen supplies `commands = { [id]: fn }` at the door.
//   That keeps this file serializable and testable with no browser, and it
//   keeps the commit where the state lives.
//
// ON REASONS. A refusal without a sentence is a dead button by another name,
// which is the defect this file exists to end. So `enabled: false` REQUIRES a
// `reason`, and the export below throws on a row that forgets one rather than
// letting a silent grey button reach a player.
