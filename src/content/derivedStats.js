  // RULESET 6 — ONE FORMAT FOR EVERY STAT AND RESOURCE (owner, 2026-09-21).
  //
  // "make mp hp and every resource now a similar calculation to AR, PR, DR,
  // etc. I'll just use decimal values to set the growth per level, in fact I'd
  // like all the resources and stats to be in the same format so that there was
  // no confusion to include the base values and everything because they are way
  // too separated."
  //
  // So a row here is now the SAME ROW a combat rating is (model/ratingFormula.js
  // — AR, DR, PR, Poise, Ward), with the level term on it:
  //
  //   base         before a single point is spent
  //   <attribute>  that attribute's decimal contribution per point, floored on
  //                its own: 0.2 gives nothing until the attribute reaches 5
  //   perLevel     DECIMAL growth per character level: 0.2 is a point every
  //                five levels, 1 is one every level
  //
  // WHAT MOVED FROM RULESET 5: nothing in the attribute terms — every weight
  // below is ruleset 5's `gainPerTier / pointsPerTier` restated, and lands on
  // the same number at every attribute value. The LEVEL terms are decimals now
  // and so are SMOOTH: HP climbs 1 per level instead of 5 every fifth level
  // (the same rate, arriving each level rather than in lumps); Mana, Stamina
  // and draw land on exactly the levels they always did. Ruleset 5 and earlier
  // are restored exactly as they were saved; only new runs read this.
  // RULESET 7 — EVERY STAT IN THIS TABLE (owner, 2026-09-24).
  //
  // "mana should be derived but mostly comes from about 4 points in wisdom
  // with some from constitution strength and intelligence … I'd like all
  // features, handsize, draw amount, actions, ar, dr, pr, ward, poise, stamina,
  // mana, hp settings to have a similiar interface and be driven by only that
  // interface. default should equal about 2 when adding all partials values as
  // the budget per with mana and stamina budget is about 1."
  //
  // So the combat ratings (AR, DR, PR, Ward, Poise — formerly model/
  // ratingFormula.js) and the hand (opening hand, per-turn draw, hand size —
  // formerly content/handRules.js and the balance fallback hand size) are rows here, in the
  // row every pool already used:
  //
  //   base         before a single point is spent (whole points)
  //   <attribute>  that attribute's decimal contribution per point, floored
  //                on its own: 0.125 gives nothing until the attribute is 8
  //   perLevel     decimal growth per character level after the first
  //   min / max    optional bounds the value never leaves
  //
  // THE BUDGET: a row's weights sum to about 2, Mana's and Stamina's to 1.
  // HP, Actions and the three hand rows are PRESERVED rather than re-budgeted
  // — a literal sum of 2 would hand out some ten extra Actions at creation —
  // and read what ruleset 6 read at every attribute 5 and at 12 in the lead
  // stat. Rulesets 1–6 are restored exactly as they were saved; only new runs
  // read this.

  // ---- D26: how each row READS, authored beside the row it describes -------

  // WHY IT IS A SIBLING OF `rules` AND NOT A FIELD ON EACH RULE. A rule row is
  // SNAPSHOTTED into every save and every co-op handshake (createDerivedStat-
  // RuleSnapshot): putting a label and a sentence in there would write prose
  // into save bytes and make a copy-edit a save-compatibility question. So
  // presentation sits outside the snapshot and inside the same FILE — one
  // author edit adds a derived stat and how it reads, and a row here with no
  // rule (or a rule with no row) is refused BY NAME at the content door
  // (derivedStatPresentationProblems, model/derivedStats.js).
  //
  //   label       the row title. These five strings were the hard-coded LABELS
  //               map in model/statProjection.js until now — a second home for
  //               a fact the table should own. Moved, not copied.
  //   faceLabel   OPTIONAL. What the chip says when the label is a phrase. Left
  //               out, the face uses `label` (Law 0 clause 3: derivation is
  //               overridable and the override is data).
  //   order       the order every stat surface reads them in.

  // a Stamina-cost card spends it — the sense line below names which — and an
  // idle turn recovers some (framework Mana & Stamina rule). The old panel once said
