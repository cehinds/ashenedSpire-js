// src/content/classArtAnchors.js — THE ONE HOME of where the sigil medallion
// sits on each painted class figure.
//
// The measurements themselves now live in
// content/config/ui/presentation/classArtAnchors.json under
// `positioning.medallionPct`. Everything below — why they are measured rather
// than derived, and how each was taken — is unchanged and binds whoever edits
// that file.
//
// Two readers and neither retypes it:
//   · runtime — src/ui/assets.js `classSprite()` positions the overlay
//   · the manifest — tools/concept-cutout.mjs emits it per sprite as
//     `anchor.medallion_center_pct`, so the inventory records the anchor the
//     game actually uses rather than a number someone typed twice
//
// WHY IT IS DATA AND NOT A HEURISTIC. The overlay used to be a single
// hardcoded `top:53%` for all four classes. That is a claim that every figure
// keeps its chest at the same height, which was true of the Blender builders —
// one rig, four palettes — and is false of four separately painted figures.
// Shipped consequence, visible in docs/art-evidence/2026-09-03: 53% lands on
// the Starseer's face under the hat brim and inside the Herald's hood opening.
//
// I did try to derive it. A silhouette-width scan finds the shoulder line on
// the Reaver and the Rogue and is defeated by the Starseer's staff and the
// Herald's halo, which widen the row profile far above the shoulders. A
// detector that is wrong on two of four figures would re-ship the same defect
// with more machinery behind it, so these are MEASURED, one per painting.
//
// HOW EACH NUMBER WAS TAKEN. The medallion disc was drawn at candidate heights
// over each sprite and inspected: the accepted value puts the whole disc on
// chest, clear of the face opening and of the collar edge above it. The disc is
// a share of the frame (7% of its height, in `classSprite()`), so a value is
// only good if that whole band is chest.
//
// IF THE ART IS REPLACED these numbers are wrong until re-measured. They are
// bound to the source paintings pinned in tools/concept-cutout.mjs `CONCEPTS`;
// that tool fails rather than guessing when a class here has no anchor.
//
// RE-MEASURED 2026-09-07, AND THE ANCHOR GREW AN X. The 2026-09-04 pass
// recorded three of these as null — "measured as unplaceable" — and named the
// two things that defeated every candidate. Both were properties of the DISC,
// not of the art, and both are fixed:
//
//   · SIZE. The disc was a fixed 22px in a 190px frame whatever the art did,
//     which covered a full-body figure's chest from collar to forearm. It is
//     now a share of the frame, in `classSprite()`, and scales with its host.
//   · POSITION. The anchor was a HEIGHT only, centred at `left: 50%` — a claim
//     that the torso is horizontally centred, which a cape sweeping to one side
//     makes false. The anchor now carries an x as well.
//
// Candidates were drawn over the SHIPPED 450x570 sprites at the shipped size,
// four per class, then the surviving pair re-inspected at the real 150x190
// combat host so the choice was judged at the size a player sees. Evidence: the
// candidate and size sheets in the 2026-09-07 anchor pass.
//
// Per class, and why that spot: the Reaver's chest plate sits in the hollow
// between his crossed forearms; the Starseer's is the V below the mantle
// collar, above the belt tabard's own gold triangle; the Rogue's is the clean
// field of the jerkin below the hood's shadow.
//
// THE HERALD IS NULL AGAIN, AND THAT IS THE POINT ITS OLD ENTRY MADE. It held
// 61, measured on the BUST, above a note saying that number is wrong the moment
// its full-body figure ships. That figure ships now, so the number went with the
// art it was measured on rather than being carried onto a painting nobody has
// held a disc against. 61% of a full-body Herald is lower robe, not chest: the
// overlay would sit on the hem.
//
// Null here is "measured as unplaceable", which `medallionDeclared` reports as
// a check rather than a gap — the runtime draws no medallion and the cutters
// still ship the sprite. Re-measure it the way the others were measured (four
// candidate discs over the shipped 450x570 sprite, the surviving pair judged
// again at the 150x190 combat host) and put the { x, y } back. Guessing one
// from the other three is the shared-assumption defect this whole file exists
// to have deleted.
//
// Headless-safe: data only, no document, no storage, no timers.
