// src/content/cards/herald.js — the Herald pool (SPEC §5.1: M3)
//
// Class identity: HP AS A RESOURCE — pay life for tempo (loseHp riders),
// spread Crimson Blight, and claw the blood back through heals that the Gold
// Figurine converts into armor. Mistakes compound: HP is one pool (GDD §4.3).
//
// M3 note: pool grown to 30 rewardable cards in the M3 content pass (toward
// SPEC's ~50). New cards deepen the blood/Blight identity — Blight spread & payoff
// (Contagion, Scourge, Cull the Weak, Blight Nova, Reclamation), HP-for-value
// (Bloodletting, Exsanguinate, Blood Harvest), and blood-fed powers (Stigmata
// heals on HP loss, Zealotry retaliates on HP loss).
