// src/content/cards/starseer.js — the Starseer pool (SPEC §5.1: M3)
//
// Class identity: STARSTONE COMBOS — the 2nd+ spell each turn is empowered.
// Mechanically pure data: each spell checks starstoneCharge FIRST (its
// "Starstone:" bonus), then applies the charge for the next spell. The
// charge is unique + turn-end decay (content/statuses.js). Weak early block
// is the designed weakness (GDD §4.3).
//
// M3 note: pool grown to 30 rewardable cards in the M3 content pass (toward
// SPEC's ~50). New cards deepen the Starstone identity — multi-hit (Star
// Slicer), AoE combos (Meteor Swarm, Radiant Spray, Starfall Beam), control
// (Frost Nova, Gravity Well), and scaling powers (Azure Coil, Waxing Moon).

// A2 Starseer starvation: the starter and common attacks (Starstone Pebble,
// Comet Fragment, Starblade Phalanx, Starlance, Frost Nova) cost actions only —
// no Mana, no Stamina — so a Starseer whose Mana carries between fights can
// still fight; their cardExposure.csv rows drop to the action-only 1 (SPEC:
// "action-only spells keep 1"). Measured with every #1284 row live,
// `node tools/runsim.mjs 120 --seeded-seats` (seat order drawn per run):
// Starseer 51/120 wins; 47/120 with these five back on 1 Stamina + 1 Mana.
