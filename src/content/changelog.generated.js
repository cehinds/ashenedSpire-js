An older build of the game won't open a save made by this one; it leaves the save untouched rather than adding cards to your deck. Your dealt deck stays the deck you were dealt.

Each press goes back one step: an open tooltip closes first, then a menu or the dialog on top, and only then the screen.

The old Cinder multiplier is set aside wherever it was saved (an imported configuration file says so), and the Cinder gain multiplier in Settings starts at 1. You still begin a climb with 20 Cinders. Character creation now offers two ways to set your stats: Standard opens on your class's own spread — mostly 1s, with its three points already placed (the Starseer starts with Intelligence 3) — ready to go, and Assign points starts every stat at 1 with 3 points for you to place, a number you can change in Advanced settings; an Assign character dodges on the same scale as a Standard one, so Dexterity 1 to 3 no longer weakens its Dodge Roll as the old attribute scale did. Your opening hand now depends on your class and is always 4 to 6 cards: a base of 3 (Reaver), 4 (Rogue, Herald) or 5 (Starseer), plus one card once your class's main stat reaches 3, never fewer than 4, so a Standard character opens with 4, 5, 5 or 6 cards. Assign points can no longer be set so low that a class could not wear the equipment it starts in, and Cancel in the Assign points window puts back the Standard stats you had chosen. Saved settings or a configuration file still holding the old opening-hand limits of 3 to 15 cards move to the new 4 to 6 and say so, and a configuration file exported from an earlier build imports again instead of being refused. Character creation shows that number as its own Hand chip, beside Draw, the cards you draw on each later turn — never more than your hand can hold.",

Now each row has its own sentence saying what the number does and what it means for a climb. Some examples: the merchant's buy-back is a fraction of the cheapest he would sell the same kind for, so below 1 selling always loses on the trade. Iron Footing is a tier-1 Reaver talent, and this row sets the Block it grants. A flask's drop chance falls after a drop and rises after a miss, and this row sets how far. The six legacy Poise and stagger rows say they only work while combat ratings are off, and name the rating row that takes over when they are on. The swap-cost numbers say which rule they price, and that choosing the rule is Weapon swap cost's job, not theirs. Two rows say plainly that nothing reads them, rather than promising to apply to a new run. The sentences are written beside their numbers in the balance table itself, so whoever changes a number reads what it does in the same place, and a test fails if a number is renamed and its sentence left behind.

A staff or sceptre makes its Strike, Defend and technique magical, and those follow PR and Ward too. Every shipped status has its own reduction multiplier, and every applicable card has a signed bonus after the shared calculation, all under five new groups in Advanced → Combat. The defaults reproduce every card's existing damage, Block and poise-damage numbers exactly, base and upgraded; moving a shared multiplier recalculates the whole matching card set deterministically. What an untouched game does change is impact: a card hit now lands its Poise or Ward value instead of a flat 1, so a cheap card or one that applies statuses can land none, while a weapon's hit keeps its weight and a card that deals its own poise damage keeps the old default beside it. X-cost cards still repeat once per Action spent, added statuses enter with a safe zero reduction, magic follows the same tags in calculation and combat, and a run or saved fight keeps the settings it started with.",

Every one of the 435 things in the game now states what it is in that tree.

All of it now lives as plain, organised settings files alongside the rest, so a value can be changed in one readable place instead of hunted through the code. Every one of those parts was recorded before the move and is held to exactly what it produced before — same values, in the same order — and a further check refuses to let a stray number creep back into the code beside its new home.",

The menu now closes the moment the fight resolves, the game refuses to save a finished fight at all, and a save already stuck that way now reopens at the fight instead of a dead end. In a co-op party, the heading over the fight and over the map said only “ACT II” where a solo run names the place — The Pale Marches, The Cinder Reach — because the host never sent it. It sends it now. And reading an enemy in co-op, the list of what it had already done always said the same thing whether it had acted or not; a co-op client can now see the moves an enemy has actually made, and an enemy that has done nothing yet says so.

The cards now sit behind a single line that says what they are (\"Adds 6 cards · 3 kinds\") — tap it to see them, three to a row and drawn small, so six faces take two rows instead of three. The Continue button at the end of each equipment step now stays pinned to the bottom of the view: before this it sat more than a screen and a half below the picker it closes, so choosing a weapon meant scrolling back past everything you had just read to leave. The Continue at the end of each creation step is pinned the same way. On a desktop or tablet screen that pinned button used to cover the equipment step's own Continue as you scrolled past it, so pressing Continue to Off Hand skipped straight to the seed instead of opening the next armament; the step's own button now sits in front. Separately, a recent change gave every screen its own words for what a card can do there — the spoils screen offers Choose this card, the merchant Buy it — and in doing so took combat's away: opening a card from your hand to read it showed the card and no button, on the one screen where that button had always worked. It is back. Playing a card from the hand itself was never affected; this is the window you open with the small i. And reading a card's information no longer follows you: the game kept a note of which card you had last read for as long as the page was open, so meeting that same card again on another screen could make your first tap act on it instead of selecting it. Each screen now starts with nothing selected. That clearing had one edge of its own, fixed here too: opening the Armoury in the middle of a fight with a card already aimed cleared the card's highlight but not the aim, so the enemies still answered to a tap and the next one you touched was struck by a card that no longer looked chosen.

On a phone, a tooltip that has nothing to tap inside it no longer swallows the tap beneath it — the starting-equipment row in character creation could not be opened because the seed hint sat on top of it — and the smaller controls (card info buttons, sliders, toggles, the potion Use button, atlas tools) now honour your Minimum tap size.

Two lists that can run longer than a screen — the inventory grid and the smith's stock — also hold their pictures back until they are scrolled near. That second habit is deliberately not applied to combat effects or to map landmarks under fog, where a picture that waits to be looked at may never arrive at all. Three artwork frames that already hid anything spilling past their edges now say so, so a sprite changing frames inside one card no longer makes the gallery around it redraw.

Two say something a summary would round off: #698's records that none of its own code was applied, and #713's records the defect its repaired gate found — hand cards overlapping Draw and End Turn at 1200x730 — which is still open.",

This set out to stop an alternative armour set being erased from the animated combat figure, but the game had already closed that gap by better means: each set draws its own authored pose sheet, one of the twelve shipped as 561 painted frames. The change offered instead was a CSS animation over the layered composite with no art behind it, so none of it was applied. What the shipped path still gives up is stated in the code rather than hidden: the armour-set palette and the held weapon do not ride on the fighter.",

    "detail": "In character creation, tapping CLASS opened the class chooser at the foot of the page — below CHARACTER, STARTING EQUIP and SEED — as though the last row had been tapped, and the same for the character and equipment rows and for the pickers nested inside them. Each panel now opens directly beneath its own row. Two things were wrong, and only one of them was in the code that places the panel. The panel is placed between the rows, so it can only land under the row you tapped if the rows are on separate lines — and the component-kit sweep of 2026-09-04 left a stylesheet rule that put all four creation rows on a single line, which leaves exactly one place to put it: after all of them. The second is that the pickers inside CHARACTER and STARTING EQUIPMENT are built while their section is hidden, where every measurement a browser can give reads zero, so they placed themselves blind and stayed where they landed; they now re-measure the moment their section is back on the glass. Driven with real clicks in a browser at 1200x730 and 390x844: every fold — the four sections, the character rows, the sprite rows nested inside those, and the equipment rows across a class change — opens immediately under its own row, one of the container's own row-gaps below it. The merchant's bars and the custom climb's shape fold, which the same renderer draws, read the same, and the Armoury's cards are untouched. Stated rather than buried: the instrument written to catch exactly this defect no longer runs at all. tools/creationbrief.mjs asks, as its seventh question, whether the panel opens under the face that was tapped; it waits on a part of the creation screen that has since been renamed, times out before asserting anything, and is not wired into CI — so nothing went red while this shipped.

None of them broke anything, which is exactly why it kept happening: an unreceipted merge is green, ships, and reads as finished. Three separate passes — #633, #641 and #653 — existed only to go back for them. A gate now refuses a promotion whose merges are not all named here, and it runs on every push to dev. It checks coverage, not prose: whether an entry exists for each merge, never whether what it says is true.

The Armoury's Character information cards behave the same way and arrive with Attributes already open. A narrow Armoury attribute row keeps its rows level and still shows the whole number rather than clipping it. Stated rather than buried: the gate this change adds does not fully pass. tools/uniform-stat-foldouts.mjs reports 33 of 34, and the one that fails is the mobile Assign Points row — INT sits 1.44px taller than the other four, because it carries the longest summary and that surface is the narrowest of the three. It reproduces on the head before this branch merged dev, so it is not merge damage, and the tool is not wired into CI, so nothing goes red for it.

CI had been reporting that death for as long as the drift had stood. The column is corrected, and the contract is now asserted against the file's own header row rather than assumed, so the next move announces itself. The working instrument then reported that the Armoury's figure and combat's figure disagree by 184px on the same weapon — every individual placement is right, the pairing is not — and bisecting with only the column fix applied puts the cause in #618, which is precisely the change about which way a sprite faces.

Both halves now assert what the value derives from rather than how it is spelled, and the freed drift slot is recorded in the plantsites baseline so the counts still match. Pre-existing rather than introduced: it reproduces on release and on the earlier test.",

A merchant rolls a 25% chance to have a smith with them, on its own die, so the roll does not disturb any other reward in a seed you have played. What is extractable is a tag on the card, the price and who offers the service are tables, and extra mounts sit behind a flag for a later rune feature. No shipped weapon authors a card package yet, so until content does, both options will tell you there is nothing to work on — the seam is live and the data is empty, as the bound table was before it.",

    "detail": "The class figure shown when you build a character, pick a style, or sit in the LAN lobby is now the painted concept design for that class, in place of the low-poly figure the Blender pipeline rendered. The Rogue changes most: its art was byte-for-byte the Reaver's, so the two classes looked identical and now do not. Your tint now colours the outfit, not just the outline. The garment takes the hue of the tint you chose while keeping the painting's own light and shadow, so the cloth changes colour without going flat; steel, bone and the dark inside a hood keep their own colour, because a dye does not touch those. The accent rim on the silhouette stays, so the figure that glows is still yours. Settings and the LAN lobby call this style Rendered, as before; its description now says \"The painted class figure\". In a fight you are now drawn as that same painted figure. Combat used to composite a low-poly Blender body in your armour set's colours, so the character builder showed one figure and the fight drew another in a different style — and the Rogue fought as the Reaver's shape repainted. The armour-set palette and the held-weapon overlay no longer show on the fighter; your weapons still show on your cards and in the Armoury. Enemy figures and act backdrops are unchanged too. These four figures were made with an AI image-generation model (ChatGPT Codex) — the game's AI disclosure and CREDITS say so, and the disclosure was rewritten and re-approved because the previous text said no image model had been used.",

Rests now open earlier than elites do, and a map that holds an elite holds a Shrine on some floor beneath it — measured across the generated maps, from 124 of 180 breaking that to none. The floor elites begin from has not moved, but the maps have: rolling a rest earlier changes what every node above it rolls, so a seed you have played before now draws a different map, elites included. What a run gains is about one more Shrine on the map, and the levels you buy at them are unchanged, because cinders were always the limit rather than the number of Shrines. The route is still yours: a path can climb past a rest and meet the elite anyway.
