// src/content/sfx.js — the SFX recipes, as data (#46; design law §3.1, Law 1).
//
// The synth engine (src/ui/audio.js) knows how to say exactly two words —
// 'tone' and 'noise' — and each recipe here is a list of layers spoken in that
// closed vocabulary. Tuning a sound (hit too loud, click too shrill) is a
// table edit here, never an engine edit: the same rule the music beds in
// music.js and the cards follow. Schema: SFX_LAYER_SCHEMAS in
// model/schemas.js; validated at boot and in tests via the content bundle
// (model/validate.js), so a malformed layer fails naming its recipe id.
//
// Layer fields (all times in seconds, frequencies in Hz, peaks are gain 0–1):
//   tone  — type (sine|square|sawtooth|triangle), freq, to? (glide target),
//           dur, peak?, t0? (delay before onset)
//   noise — dur, peak?, t0?, hp? (highpass Hz), lp? (lowpass Hz)
//
// `default` is required: it is what an id with no entry plays — a quiet,
// audible beep, so a missing recipe is heard, never silent (Law 1 clause 5).
//
// THE ID SCHEME — composed ids, and why this table has a family row (#66/D16).
// A call site may compose an id from data: `procBurst_${status}` (ui/fx.js).
// Resolution is generic-then-specific, in resolveRecipe() below:
//
//     procBurst_frost  →  the exact row if authored
//                      →  else `procBurst`, the FAMILY row (before the '_')
//                      →  else `default`
//
// So a per-status row is an OPTIONAL flourish, never a requirement: the day
// content authors a fourth proc status, its burst already sounds like a burst
// instead of degrading to the 440 Hz blip. That is Law 1 clause 3 — new
// combinations of existing vocabulary must just work, with no engine edit.
// Authoring a new family = one row named for the id before the underscore.
//
// Found by Sunna at #66: #65 started composing `procBurst_<status>` and no row
// answered, so bleed, frost AND insanity all played the fallback while the
// settings screen named sounds the build did not make.

// A recipe id automatically tries assets/sfx/<encoded-id>.ogg before using its
// synth recipe. Add a row here only to override that path or format; both the
// convention and overrides pass through assetUrl() so standalone builds can
// inline them. A cue synths immediately while an unknown file warms; only a
// cached known-good file replaces later cues. Missing/undecodable files remain
// unavailable in that cache, so every cue keeps the immediate recipe below.

  // and `procBurst_bleed` the same sound — 0.5 dB apart A-weighted, measured —

  beat: CONFIRM_ARRIVAL_RECIPE,
  // ---- the hold family: a press-and-hold has a BEAT ------------------------
  //
  // THE SCORE, written out because this house has no ears and a sound nobody
  // can check is decoration. Four sounds make ONE PHRASE, and the phrase is
  // "approach, approach, approach, arrive":
  //
  //   tick   tick  tick      COMMIT
  //   A3     A3    A3        A3 -> E4, with A4 over it
  //   |------|-----|---|
  //   0.00   0.42  0.78  1.0        (fractions of the fill; balance.ui.holdBeat)
  //
  // Every tick is the SAME NOTE. Nothing rises in pitch — the gaps shorten, and
  // that is the whole progress signal (the reason is in balance.ui.holdBeat, one
  // home). The commit is that same A arriving UP: 220 glides to 330 (a fifth)
  // with a quiet 440 (the octave) laid over it 25 ms later. So the landing is
  // heard as the ticks resolving rather than as a fifth unrelated event, and a
  // player learns the phrase in one run without being told anything.
  //
  // WHY A3 = 220 Hz. It is an octave under `cardPlay` (520->380) and two under
  // `relic`, so a confirmation never competes with the sound of the thing being
  // confirmed. A phone speaker rolls off hard below ~500 Hz, so on the shape
  // that matters the fundamental is barely there and the TRIANGLE'S ODD
  // HARMONICS (660, 1100, 1540...) are what actually arrives — which is why the
  // tick is a triangle and not a sine. A 35 ms sine has no transient to hear.
  //
  // WHY NOT THE OTHER TIMBRES: square reads as an error tone (it is `stagger`
  // and half of `procBurst_insanity`); sawtooth is the bleed/death material;
  // noise is impact, and a confirmation is not an impact. The tick is the only
  // dry, unfiltered, single-layer row in this table on purpose.
  //
  // THE LEVELS, AND THE TRADE I TOOK. `holdTick` peak 0.10 is the QUIETEST row
  // here — under `default`'s 0.15 — and 35 ms is the shortest. It fires three
  // times per confirmation and hundreds of times a run, so it is the one sound
  // in the game whose cost is paid at hold #200 rather than hold #1. It is
  // audible because it is dry and transient against a sustained bed, NOT
  // because it is loud; buying audibility with gain would be the wrong fix and
  // the mix would be the thing at fault.
  //
  // `holdCommit` peak 0.30 sits UNDER `cardPlay`'s 0.35, deliberately and at a
  // cost: the more satisfying sound is louder. But a confirmation is not a
  // bigger event than the card it confirms, and a mix where the guard
  // out-shouts the action is lying about what mattered.
  //
  // THERE IS NO `holdAbort`, AND THE ABSENCE IS THE DECISION. Letting go is
  // nothing happening, and the honest sound for nothing happening is nothing.
  // It is also the COMMON case — releasing early IS the feature — so a cue
  // there would become the most-fired sound in the game while reporting a
  // non-event. The train stopping already says it.
  //
  // COMPOSED PER ACTION, exactly like `procBurst_<status>` above:
  //   holdCommit_endTurn -> the exact row if some future author writes one
  //                      -> else `holdCommit`, this family row
  // So the day an action becomes one that "takes a second beat", it already
  // sounds right with no engine edit and no content edit. A per-action row is
  // an OPTIONAL flourish. None is authored here on purpose: this table deleted
  // `uiClick` for being a shipped sound with no caller, and a `holdCommit_x`
  // for an x that does not hold yet would be the same lie in a new coat.
