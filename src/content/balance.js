// src/content/balance.js — every global tuning constant (SPEC §3.1(4))
//
// Code never embeds a balance number; a balance change is a one-file diff here.

import { tooltipHelp } from './tooltipHelp.js';

// ---- WHAT EACH NUMBER DOES, WRITTEN BESIDE IT (owner, 2026-09-23) ----------
//
// Every object below carries a `[NOTE]` block beside its own numbers: the
// sentence Settings → Advanced shows under each row. They lived in
// model/balanceNotes.js until the owner asked for them here, and the reason
// is the one this file's header gives for the numbers — a description kept in
// a second file drifts from the number it describes, because nobody editing
// the number sees it. Two of the sentences reviewed in #1243 had been copied
// from a comment in this file that the code had since outgrown.
//
// THE KEY IS A SYMBOL, and that is what lets a sentence sit inside an object
// the engine reads as numbers. `Object.keys`, `Object.entries`, JSON and
// structuredClone all skip it, so `validate.js`'s unknown-field checks,
// model/advancedConfig.js's `leafRows` and every engine reader walk past it:
// `balance.shop.sellFraction` is still 0.5 and `balance.shop` still has the
// keys it had. `Symbol.for`, so a second copy of this module shares the key.
//
// HOW TO WRITE ONE. A key names a number by its path under the object that
// holds the block:
//
//   sellFraction: 'What the merchant pays …'           this one number
//   '{kind}Cost.{rarity}.{end}': 'The {band} of …'     every number of a family
//   '{statId}.perLevel': { text: '…', inert: true }    a number nothing reads
//
// `{name}` in a key captures a path segment. In a sentence, `{name}` is a
// blank model/balanceNotes.js fills with a NAME — a relic's from the relic, a
// class's from the class — and `{a name}` fills it with its article too.
// Nothing there writes prose; the phrases it picks between are `balanceWords`
// below. Every note but an inert one ends with `balanceWords.newRun`; an
// inert one says nothing reads it, and does not then promise to apply.
//
// A number with no note falls back to "Authored balance value: <path>", and
// tests/advanced-config.test.mjs fails on it. So does a note naming a number
// that is not here, which is what keeps a sentence and its number together:
// rename the number without moving its sentence and the test says so.

  // which attributes may be raised is `content/attributes.js` — adding a sixth
  // attribute puts a sixth button on the shrine with no UI edit, and that is
  // this feature's Law 0 falsifier. What a point is WORTH is

      //               is this screen good?
      //   the WALL  — `.end-turn` UNREACHABLE: not one pixel on glass and no
      //               gesture to it. A SAFETY question: can this player continue?
      // They part by 64-109 px at every text size (Vira, 2026-08-15). MARINA
      // RULED THE WALL, for three reasons and the third decides it alone:
      //   1. the gate's cost is TOTAL — it removes the shape and says rotate —
      //      and a total hammer should fire on a total condition;
      //   2. a refusal removes the player's choice, a degraded screen leaves it.
      //      At 67.3% of the hand a player can rotate, page or accept. Behind the
      //      gate they cannot opt out;
      //   3. `whole` CAN BE SATISFIED BY THE VERY INTERACTION THAT STRANDS THE
      //      PLAYER — one flask gesture at 844x390 scrolls `.combat` 162.9 px and
      //      takes the screen from 2/5 + UNREACHABLE to 5/5 + onscreen, carrying
      //      the topbar off the top with no gesture back. A refusal predicate the
      //      trap itself satisfies is the wrong question.

      //   Re-measured from 360 (Bjorn, 2026-08-16): XL is walled at every swept
      //   cell from the floor to 450.
      //
      //   AND 360 IS THE NEW FLOOR, NOT A NEW EDGE. The wall's LOWER edge is
      //   still unestablished — at 360 all four text sizes are walled, so each
      //   run's bottom is the sweep's, not the board's. Writing `360` as though
      //   it were measured is the same mistake one floor down. IT DOES NOT
      //   MATTER TO THE NUMBER: the derivation is max(wall)+1 and needs only the
      //   wall's TOP edge, which is inside the sweep at every text size. That is
      //   why a wrong lower bound sat here harmlessly and why it still had to go
      //   — a bound that costs nothing today is read as measured tomorrow.
      //
      // 465 IS ONE PAST THE LAST WALL — max(368, 395, 424, 465). NOT the first
      // height that stops being a wall, WHICH WOULD BE 451 AND WOULD BE WRONG BY
      // FOURTEEN. `min(good)` is a monotonic idea and this ground is not
      // monotonic; I measured the non-monotonicity myself (97.13% at h 485, 94.4%
      // at 486), used it to justify sweeping exhaustively, and still derived with
      // `min(good)`. One past the last bad cell is the only form that survives a
      // hole, and the hole is real.
      //
      // AND I CHECKED THE SAME QUESTION AGAINST THE COST COLUMN, because a
      // corrected derivation that leaves its neighbour uncorrected is the same
      // defect at a new address: at all four text sizes `min(whole)` and
      // `max(not-whole)+1` COINCIDE (432/495/533/571 either way). The whole set
      // is contiguous above its first cell; the wall set is not. That is a

      //            (33 heights) are FULLY WHOLE — a perfect screen, refused.
      //            (This read `390..464` and carried THE SAME sweep-floor default
      //            as the XL wall above — one defect, two addresses, one comment
      //            block. 368 is max(wall)+1 at Text S and is floor-independent,

      // THE OPTION I MEASURED AND DID NOT INSTALL, because the shape of the
      // threshold is a design ruling and not mine: a per-text-size TABLE on the
      // premise — {S 368, M 395, L 424, XL 465} — is better on BOTH edges at
      // once. It covers every wall AND refuses no reachable screen at any text
      // size except the 451..463 gap at XL. My Law 4 objection to a table
      // ("an accessibility setting that takes screens away as you turn it up")
      // was true of a table on `whole` and is FALSE of a table on the premise:
      // it refuses a large-text player only the heights where that player is
      // actually walled. Vira found the step I generalised over; the objection
      // was a property of the predicate, not of the shape. What it costs is the
      // thing the single number hides: at Text S a landscape phone is handed a
      // board with 67.3% of the hand and 86.4% of the orb, both CLIPPED WITH NO
      // SCROLL PATH, and nothing refuses it. Whether that board is playable is a
      // player-experience finding and it is filed with this act.

    // Constantine: "just make the tabs about 20% smaller or the size
    // configurable or scalable with UI or both" — and then, on the 44 floor,
    // "actually, I think it should be able to go smaller than 44px." Sunna
    // measured why the second half of the first sentence could never answer
    // him: `calc(44px / var(--ui-zoom))` under `body { zoom }` renders
    // 44 x zoom / zoom, so the floored controls are the one part of the
    // interface UI size cannot reach — 44.00 device px in all 20 UI-size x
    // shape cells, zero variance. So it is configurable, and this is the data.
    //
    // `sizes` IS THE CLOSED SET, largest first — that order is the order the

    // line below 44 says less about them rather than inventing a number
    // (Sunna's ruling; Law 0 clause 5 is the same sentence about derivation).
    //
    // ADDING A FIFTH SIZE IS A ROW HERE AND NOTHING ELSE: it appears as a chip,
    // it applies, and it gets a cost line with no percentage unless someone
    // adds one. Removing `missRate` for a size removes the percentage and keeps
    // the sentence. That is the falsifier for Law 0 on this control.

    // WHAT IT IS FOR, and the number that made it necessary. The event screen's
    // three choice bars are 44/44/44 across sixteen cells — the size is fixed
    // and it did not help, because THE GAPS ARE 9-9.7 px at every dial setting
    // and nothing in this game reads a gap. Targets grow, the space between
    // them does not, so a thumb that lands 9 px low lands on the NEIGHBOUR —
    // and on this screen the neighbour is "permanent curse", with no confirm
    // and no undo. Constantine, asked: "yes press and hold".
    //
    // WHY BOTH FORMS SHIP. A short activation opens the shared review modal so
    // the player sees the exact result and optional cost. A deliberate hold
    // fills on the original control and commits without the modal for players
    // who already know the result. Releasing the hold early remains an abort.
    //
    // `steps` IS THE CLOSED SET, in dial order, and `off` is first because it
    // is the A/B — the same "let me try each and decide" he asked for on the
    // map. The Advanced row derives its `choices` and its `def` from these keys
    // and nothing restates them; ADDING A FIFTH SPEED IS A ROW HERE AND NOTHING
    // ELSE. That is the falsifier for Law 0 on this control, and it is the same
    // sentence tapSize above already ships.
    //
    // `normal` is the default: state-changing option controls now use a short
    // press to review and a deliberate hold to approve without the modal.
    // 600 ms sits just past the familiar ~400-500 ms long-press threshold
    // ms (Android's own threshold) and a CONFIRM wants to sit just past reflex
    // without becoming a chore. `short` is for players who find the wait
    // irritating, `long` for hands that need the room. `off` is 0 and disables
    // only the shortcut; the short activation still opens the review modal.

      // Armoury tray, an inventory card you can drag — that meant every drag
      // began with a hold animation flashing and dying under the thumb. The
      // gesture was correct and the feedback was a lie.
      //
      // Nothing is dressed, painted or announced until the pointer has held
      // still inside the slop for `settleMs`. Move first and this press is a
      // drag: the hold never existed, so it has nothing to take back.
      //
      // `settleMs` is time BEFORE the hold, and the hold's own duration starts
      // when the settle ends — a `long` hold on a dragging surface is
      // 1000 + 1000. That ordering is deliberate: the fill should represent the
      // whole of the commitment, not resume a bar that already crept while the
      // player was deciding whether to scroll. Setting `settleMs: 0` restores
      // the old immediate arm exactly, and a surface may override it per call.
      //
      // WHY IT IS NOT ON EVERY CONTROL. A control with no drag beneath it has

      // it even begins to look like it is working reads as a broken button.

    // durations are holdConfirm above. Three facts, three homes, none restated.
    //
    // WHY THE HOLD NEEDS ONE AT ALL, and it is a measurement rather than a
    // taste. The fill is the only feedback the hold has, and on the event
    // screen it works: the bar is 378x44 at 390x844 and a thumb covers a
    // fraction of it. END TURN IS 190.2x50.4 AT y=784.6 OF AN 844 px VIEWPORT
    // — a control roughly the size of the contact patch, in the bottom 60 px,
    // approached from below. The hand that presses it is on top of the only
    // thing telling the player the press was received. A hold with no beat is
    // then indistinguishable from a tap that did not register, and the player
    // presses again — so the guard fires the thing twice.
    //
    // `at` IS THE CLOSED SET, as fractions of the fill, ascending, and 1.0 is
    // NOT in it: the arrival is `holdCommit`, a different sound with a
    // different job, and putting it here would give the landing two homes.
    //
    // THE SPACING IS THE MESSAGE, not decoration. The gaps shorten (0.42,
    // 0.36, 0.22) so the train ACCELERATES toward the commit: a player hears
    // "approaching" without counting anything, and an abort at 0.5 has heard a
    // train that was speeding up and then stopped, which is the true sentence
    // about what happened. An evenly spaced train is a metronome, and a
    // metronome says only "time is passing".
    //
    // ACCELERATION AND NOT PITCH, which is a composition decision with a
    // maintenance reason. A rising train would need one recipe per tick
    // (`holdTick_1..3`), and the day someone adds a fourth fraction here the
    // fourth tick has no row and the rise breaks — the row edit this comment
    // promises would stop being enough. Identical ticks getting closer
    // together is the same signal, and a fourth fraction just works.
    //
    // WHY THREE. One tick cannot rise. Two can, barely. Four plus a commit is
    // five sounds on every confirmation and this fires many times a run — the
    // cost of a charming sound is paid at hold #200, not hold #1. Three is the
    // fewest that reads as a gesture. TUNING IS THIS ROW: an empty array is
    // legal and means the ticks are off with the commit intact.
    //
    // The first tick is at 0.00 on purpose — it is the "pressed" report, and a
    // report that arrives at 180 ms has already let the player wonder.

    // Constantine, 2026-08-08: press-and-hold a card and it "expands" and comes

    // the hand itself is arranged) is HELD on C2 and no number for it lives
    // here or anywhere.
    //
    // WHY THIS IS NOT holdConfirm's DIAL, though both are a stationary press
    // with a timer. Two different jobs (Law 4's shape, applied to time): the
    // confirm hold is a SHORTCUT around the review modal — its length is a
    // protection preference, and `off` means "review only". The inspect
    // hold is how a player READS a card — turning the safety dial off must not
    // take reading away, and a hand that needs a longer confirm does not
    // thereby need slower reading. One dial answering both would break the
    // weaker job the day anyone tunes the stronger one.
    //
    // 400 ms: the bottom of the long-press convention players already know
    // (Android's own threshold is ~400-500), BELOW the confirm's 600 default
    // because reading is cheaper than committing and fires far more often —
    // and above any tap: the slow edge of a deliberate tap is ~250 ms, and a
    // stationary press that outlives 400 was not going to become one. The
    // known cost, stated rather than hidden: a tap slower than this becomes an
    // inspect, whose release then does nothing — the card visibly expanding IS
    // the feedback that says why. `ms: 0` is the off position: no inspect,

    // rather than quietly preferring one.
    //
    // NOTHING NEW IS AUTHORED (Law 0 clause 1). `tags` is a column weapons.csv
    // has always had; three plain rows now carry `basic` and the shelf follows.
    // Moving the line between "for all" and "profile specific" is editing that
    // column — no code, which is the whole promise. Set it to '' to switch the
    // universal shelf off entirely; a value naming a tag no armament carries is

    //
    // THE UNLESS-CLAUSE NEEDED NO CODE, AND THAT IS A MEASUREMENT, NOT A HOPE.
    // The worry was that clearing this tag would also hide the pieces the player
    // STARTED with — his exemption is the starting kit, not a category. It does
    // not, because the kit is WORN: `carriedIds(loadout)` is storage plus every
    // set, and `createRunState` puts the kit in the sets. Measured across all
    // three shipped classes at this ref:
    //

    // stood is not fixed by a better name alone; it is fixed by a name a reader

    //   · 28q is the ONLY test in tests/engine.test.js that DECLARES the fourth
    //     cell — `{ id: 'both', base: 'category', gear: true }` — and then prices
    //     all four cells of the base × gear product, asserting '2,3,3,4'.
    //   · 28p asserts the shipped rows are exactly `flat,gear,category`. It
    //     measures the three and never builds a fourth.
    //   · 28r holds the two fields APART: its one gear clause refuses a
    //     non-boolean `gear` by name, and its base sweep runs `gear: false`
    //     throughout, so the fourth cell never occurs in it either.
