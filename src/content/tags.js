// src/content/tags.js — THE tag vocabulary, and who carries it.
//
// One registry for the whole game, in third normal form. A card's school, a
// weapon's identity, a creature's kind, a class's leaning — all of it is rows
// in one set of tables, and nothing may carry a tag that is not registered.
// Tagging anything is a spreadsheet row, never a code change. Five tables,
// which since the tag tree are VIEWS: tools/content-build.mjs derives the first
// three from content/source/nodes.csv (every tag is a node; a root is what
// these tables call a domain) and familyNodes.csv, and the readers below keep
// their contract unchanged:
//
//   tagDomains        the roots of nodes.csv — what a tag can be ABOUT
//   tags              every non-root node — id, domain (its root), chip
//   content/source/tagFamilies.csv      what can be tagged — source, scopeField
//   tagFamilyDomains  familyNodes.csv lifted to roots — who may carry what
//   content/source/tagging.csv          family, scope, objectId, tagId
//
// WHY FIVE TABLES AND NOT TWO. The first cut had a `domains` list on the family
// row, a `tags` list in the association table, and a `tags` COLUMN on every
// family that happened to be authored as a spreadsheet row. Every one of those
// is a repeating group in a cell — a 1NF break — and the last one was worse
// than untidy: it was a second home, so the same tag could be written in two
// places and drift. Normalising removed the lists and, with them, the second
// home. There is now exactly one place a tag on anything is written.
//
// WHY A DOMAIN AT ALL: one file holding the whole vocabulary would otherwise
// make 'beast' a legal card school and 'blade' a legal creature kind. Each
// family is paired with the domains it may draw from, and the validator refuses
// the rest — one home for the words, without collapsing a distinction the
// engine depends on (creature tags gate proc resistance).
//
// WHY A SCOPE COLUMN: an outfit's id is unique per class, not globally, so the
// parent key of `armour` is (classId, id). A junction row must carry the whole
// parent key or it identifies nothing — `scope` is that second half, and the
// family's `scopeField` names which field it came from. Every other family
// leaves it empty.
//
// Nothing here mutates content. Resolution is a lookup, so a bad tag shows up
// as a named validation failure rather than a silently missing chip.
