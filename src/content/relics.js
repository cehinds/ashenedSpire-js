// src/content/relics.js — the relic pool (SPEC §5.4 base set + M3 growth to 40)
//
// WHAT IS STILL HERE, AND WHAT MOVED (plan phase 2). A relic's run-system
// behaviour — rewards, shops, shrines, map, costs — is the closed passive-key
// set, and it is still here, because a relic's passives are upgraded PER COPY
// at the smith (model/itemUpgrades.js resolveUpgradedRelic) and a property rule
// is one global row with nowhere to record a tier. Its COMBAT behaviour is not:
// the triggers left for content/source/nodeEffects.json, keyed by a
// property tag that shares the relic's id, and the relic mounts them through
// the same door equipment does (engine/properties.js). A relic that authors
// `triggers` here again is refused by name, with the file to move them to.
//
// The sentence below each relic did NOT move, and that is deliberate: it covers
// the whole relic, both halves, and splitting it would renumber its own
// `{block.2}` tokens for no reader's benefit. It reads its numbers from both
// homes (model/validate.js relicTokens).
// One deliberate retune vs. the SPEC table: Bloodied Talisman deals a flat
// +5 on Bleed bursts instead of +25% (the burst amount isn't visible to a
// trigger; flat rider keeps it pure data — revisit in the M3 balance pass).
//
// M3 content pass: 20 → 40. New relics reuse only shipped statuses/opcodes and
// proven trigger shapes. One design note worth keeping: relics that GRANT BLOCK
// on turn 1 fire on `playerTurnStart` (once), never `combatStart` — combat-start
// block is wiped by the turn-1 block-expiry (SPEC §4.1). See Goldleaf Charm.
