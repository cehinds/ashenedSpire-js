// Every choice is a real trade-off, StS-style. `requires` is checked by the
// event screen (e.g. { cinders: 50 }); `effects` are run-level opcodes executed
// via executeRunEffects. A startCombat effect hands control to the combat
// orchestrator after resultText is shown. SPEC §9 M3 target: 10 events.

    // Plan phase 5c: the one shipped door to the class swap — an event, never
    // a menu. The glass shows another calling; the run keeps its deck, relics,
    // hands and weapon skills, and starts its class over.
