// THE ONE HOME FOR HOW BIG A CARD IS.
//
// Every card in the game is one renderer — `.epc-frame` is a fixed 350x490
// design-pixel canvas that is transform-scaled into whatever box holds it, so
// the container's width IS the card's size. Before this file there was no
// authored size at all: nine surfaces each wrote their own `max-width` into
// styles/kit.css, and the card came out whatever that number happened to be.
// Measured at b3130e515, one renderer, two viewports:
//
//   shop armaments   315x441 desktop / 236x330 phone   (no cap at all —
//                    the card simply inherited the 280px shelf track)
//   armoury faces    305x427 / 228x320                 (max-width:280px)
//   inspect modal    264x370 / 144x202                 (max-width:220px)
//   cc summary slot  216x302 / 162x227                 (max-width:180px)
//   cc picker        154x215 / 130x182                 (max-width:152px)
//
// A 2.05x spread on the desktop, and — the part that was a bug rather than an
// inconsistency — INSPECT CAME OUT SMALLER THAN FOCUS. The one surface whose
// job is to show you everything was the second-smallest card on the screen,
// and its effect text was silently cut off the bottom of the face with no
// ellipsis and no scroller. Size is now three authored numbers, here:
//
//   content/config/ui/components/card.json -> sizing.levels
//
// THE LEVEL NAMES ARE SHARED, AND DELIBERATELY ONLY THREE. `glance | focus |
// inspect` is one vocabulary: this file decides how BIG the card is at each
// level and the field manifest decides WHICH FIELDS it shows. A fourth level
// name would fork that vocabulary, so the one surface that genuinely needs a
// different width — the character-creation picker's list view, whose cards sit
// beside their own text — declares a VARIANT of glance rather than a level of
// its own. A variant is authored data with a name; it is not a new CSS rule.

const LEVELS = ['glance', 'focus', 'inspect'];

// THE ONE HOME FOR WHAT SHAPE A CARD IS, for the same reason as the widths
// above — and it was a LIVE Law 1 violation, not a tidy-up. Measured at
// c63a09620, one renderer, eight surfaces, two viewports:
//
//   combat hand / shop shelf / reward pick / inspect modal / co-op    5 / 8
//   deck+discard piles / armoury card gallery / cc starting fold      5 / 7
//
// The same card, two shapes, decided by which screen it landed on. And the
// authored number had no reach: `content/config/ui/components/card.json`
// declared `sizing.ratio` and `sizing.bands`, but its ONLY readers were
// HandLayout and CombatLayout — the hand's geometry maths. The card's own face
// was drawn by `styles/kit.css`, which wrote `aspect-ratio: 5 / 8` and
// `grid-template-rows: ...1fr 4fr 4fr 1fr` out a SECOND time, with no link
// between them. Editing the JSON moved the hand's arithmetic and left the card
// looking exactly as it had.
//
// WHICH SHAPE WON, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE JSON'S OLD NUMBER. SPEC.md is the
// source of truth (CONTRIBUTING §1) and states the playing card's shape once:
// "the solo hand ... preserving its 5:7 aspect ratio" (§12). There is no 5:8
// anywhere in SPEC.md. docs/COMPONENT-CATALOG.md says the shipped
// `player-hand-tray` is "Fixed 5:7 card faces". styles/combat.css says it twice
// more, in rules that carry their own comment ("A hand card has one portrait
// profile") and pin 178 x 249.2 px — 5:7 exactly. The 5:8 came from
// docs/WIREFRAME-FIRST-REBUILD-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md ("Cards | 5:8 ratio;
// 10/40/40/10 bands"), a rebuild plan rather than the spec, and reached the
// tree as this JSON and the WC1 stylesheet rule. So the spec's shape is the
// card's shape, and it now has one home:
//
//   content/config/ui/components/card.json -> sizing.ratio, sizing.bands
//

// through wireframeUi, and the stylesheet reads the custom properties below.

/**
 * A SHELF OF RESTING CARDS: how many stand on one row, and how narrow a card

 *
 * The merchant photographed at 1328x744 was the case this exists for. Its
 * armament shelf laid out `width: min(280px, 100%)` tiles — the FOCUS width,
 * around a card rendered at the GLANCE width of 152px — in an offers column
 * half the pane wide. Two tiles did not fit, so the shelf wrapped to ONE card
 * per row and the other two were below the fold, behind a scroll, each sitting
 * in 128px of empty panel. Five shelves, five different wrappers, and not one
 * of them had a number that said how many cards a row is meant to hold.
 *
 * So a shelf is authored, once, at
 *
 *   content/config/ui/components/card.json -> sizing.shelf
 *
 * as three numbers and one rule: `maxColumns` cards across, `gapPx` between
 * them, and never a track narrower than `minTrackPx`. A shelf too narrow for
 * `maxColumns` at that floor drops a column rather than shaving the cards —
 * the complaint being answered is cards you cannot see, and a card shaved to
 * 80px is one of those. `minTrackPx` is therefore a floor on legibility, not a
 * preferred size: a track wider than the floor is used in full, up to the
 * resting width, which is the widest a card at rest is ever drawn.
 *
 * THE ARITHMETIC HERE MIRRORS ONE CSS RULE and exists so it can be asked a
 * question from Node. `.card-shelf` in styles/kit.css is a wrapping flex row
 * whose items take `flex-basis: max(--card-shelf-min, track)`; the browser then
 * fits `floor((W + gap) / (basis + gap))` of them per row. That is exactly
 * `cardShelfColumnsAt`, and the two are checked against each other by
 * tests/card-shelf.test.mjs rather than by eye.

  // and the config builder would have refused it.
  //
  // So it is nested to match the file's own shape and MERGED AT THE ROOT. The
  // first attempt at this got the instruction wrong in the other direction —
  // the settings row said "paste it over `sizing.levels`", which with this
  // nesting yields `sizing.levels.sizing.levels` and no tuned rows at all.
  // Shape and instruction have to agree, so `cardSizingExportPath` states the
  // destination once and the UI row reads from the same idea rather than
  // describing it again in its own words.
