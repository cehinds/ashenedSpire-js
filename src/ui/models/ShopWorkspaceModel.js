/**
 * THE OFFERS COLUMN IS WIDE ENOUGH FOR A SHELF OF CARDS, not a bare fraction.
 *
 * `offersFraction` gave the offers half the pane whatever was standing in it.
 * Measured at 1328x744: rail 287, pane 1000, offers 490 — and an armament
 * shelf needs 644px to stand four resting cards side by side, so it wrapped to
 * ONE card per row with the rest behind a scroll. The authored fraction was
 * never wrong about what the offers deserve at rest; it simply had no idea
 * what it was holding.
 *
 * So the share is a FLOOR, not the answer: the offers take their authored
 * fraction, or as much as a full shelf of resting cards needs, whichever is
 * larger — bounded by what the detail column can spare (`detailMinRem`, this
 * screen's own authored floor, because the detail here is a short stack of
 * facts rather than a reading door). Asking for more than a full shelf would
 * only stretch the gaps: the shelf never draws a card above its resting width.
 * Below the bound the offers keep the authored fraction and the shelf drops a
 * column, which is the shelf's own rule, not a second one written here.
 *
 * `rem` is the measured root size in CSS px, the same term the rest of this
 * model's rem numbers are resolved with — the app's root is `font-size: 62.5%`,
 * so a rem here is about ten pixels, which is the currency `railMinRem: 11`
 * and `wideMinRem: 60` are already counted in.
 *
 * `restingPx` is how wide a resting card is ACTUALLY being drawn: the authored
 * glance width, or a tuned one, or the phone's own variant. It is passed in
 * rather than read from the authored table because the table is not the last
 * word — `applyCardSizeSettings` in main.js lays a player's overrides over it
 * and projects the result as `--card-w-glance`. Reading the authored 152 here
 * while the cards on the shelf were drawn at 100 would have reserved 644px for
 * four of them where 436 was needed, squeezing the detail column to buy room
 * nothing was going to stand in — the model claiming the offers take what
 * their shelf needs while taking what a different shelf would have needed.

 * pane's `--modal-inset` padding, whatever chrome is added next. An earlier
