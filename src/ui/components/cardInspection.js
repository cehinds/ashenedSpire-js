// WHICH CARD IS LIT AND HOW MANY BEATS IT HAS SPENT now live in
// ./cardSelection.js. They were two module-level `let`s here — shared by every
// card on the page, with `.inspection-selected` in the DOM as a second copy of
// the same fact and a `document.querySelectorAll` sweep reconciling them. That
// is why three shipped changes in three days broke the tap accounting: the
// state had no name, no test, and no way to be asked a question.
//
// The behaviour is unchanged. Selection is still page-wide; the sweep is gone
// because a card now hands the store the callback that puts it out.

// THE DOOR'S SHAPE BELONGS TO THE DOOR, NOT TO THE APP SHELL.
//
// Below the inspect card's own width plus the readable measure beside it there
// is no room for two columns, and the door reads top to bottom instead. A media
// query cannot read a custom property, so the comparison happens in JS and the
// stylesheet keys on `data-card-door` — which keeps card.json the one home for
// both numbers rather than having a breakpoint restate one of them.
//
// This lived in `src/main.js` and was WRONG THERE, measured rather than argued.
// Walking the import graph from every module script in every page at the repo
// root, FIVE pages reach this module and only ONE of them boots `main.js`:
//
//   index.html                  -> src/main.js                  door + main
//   armament-kits-preview.html  -> inline module script          door, no main
//   item-cards-preview.html     -> src/ui/previews/itemCards.js  door, no main
//   tooltip-review-scene.html   -> .../tooltipReviewEntry.js     door, no main
//   weapon-cards-preview.html   -> .../weaponCards.js            door, no main
//
// On those four the attribute was never written, so the door kept two columns
// at every width — measured on weapon-cards-preview.html at 390x844, the
// details column was 24.969px. That is not a column, it is a seam. The fix was
// in the app and the defect was in the component.
//
// (An earlier version of this comment named `docs/architecture-handoff/wireframe-gallery.html`
// as a host. It is not one and never was: it has a single CLASSIC script tag
// and no module script at all, and its 86 mentions of this file are embedded
// source-listing TEXT, not imports. The list above is the measured one.)
//
// So the decision sits beside the layout it governs. One listener for this
// module's life rather than one per door: the attribute is on `:root`, one door
// is open at a time, and a per-door listener would be a leak with no reader.
// THE THRESHOLD IS READ, NOT REMEMBERED. It was a module-level `const`
// computed once from the authored config, which was fine while the widths were
// authored-only and wrong the moment they became tunable: turning the inspect
// slider up moved `--card-w-inspect` and left the breakpoint at the old 704, so
// the door would sit beside a card too wide to fit next to it. The effective
// inspect width is whatever has been projected onto `:root`; the authored sum
// is the fallback for a page that projects nothing.
let doorShapeWatched = false;
// PIXELS OR NOTHING. A custom property is UNREGISTERED here, so
// `getPropertyValue` hands back the token exactly as it was written rather than
// a resolved length — and `parseFloat` is happy to read `20rem` as 20 and `50%`
// as 50. That would have silently put the threshold at 404 instead of 704 and
// looked like it was working. Only a bare px length is read; anything else

// MEASURE THE DOOR, NOT THE WINDOW. This compared `window.innerWidth`, and the
// door is not the window: the reading modal is `size: 'lg'`, capped at 76rem,
// so at a 1440px viewport the layout is 748px whatever the screen does. While
// the inspect width was authored-only that gap was merely conservative and I
// wrote it down as an accepted caveat. Making the width TUNABLE turned it into
// the original defect, reachable from the new slider — measured at 1440:
//
//   inspect 320 (authored) -> beside, details 393px   fine
//   inspect 560            -> beside, details 153px   squeezed
//   inspect 800            -> beside, details   0px   gone
//
// So the comparison is against the layout's OWN width. A ResizeObserver is the
// honest instrument: the layout's width is set by the modal and does not depend
// on the columns we choose, so reading it and then changing
// `grid-template-columns` cannot feed back into itself. Before the layout is in

// preview: two `.card-inspection-layout` nodes, both inside the modal; forcing

      // this candidate, arm this burn — could only be reached on the THIRD.
      // #980 fixed the count by handing tap ONE to the action (`actionOwnsTouch`
      // on the Smith and the merchant), which cost the selecting beat: a thumb
      // committed to a candidate it had not yet been shown.

      // card that has an act: THE FIRST TAP SELECTS AND NOTHING ELSE; every tap
      // after it on the SAME card reaches the host's own handler. The `i` the
      // first tap reveals is a door beside the act, never in front of it, and a
      // press-and-hold is unaffected — it never came through `click` at all.
      //
      // `actionOwnsTouch` survives for the surfaces with no selecting beat to
      // spend (a card in the combat hand, the reward chooser whose click only
      // selects); `touchSelectionSafe` still lets a card whose act needs a
      // target keep its first tap.
