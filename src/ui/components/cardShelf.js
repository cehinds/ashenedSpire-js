/**
 * THE SHELF TELLS ITS OWN ITEMS HOW MANY OF THEM A ROW HOLDS.
 *
 * `.card-shelf` (styles/kit.css) lays resting cards out on its own, from three
 * authored numbers, and that is the whole rule where no script is running — a
 * preview page, a screenshot harness, the kit's own component gallery. What it
 * cannot do alone is agree with ITSELF across two rows.
 *
 * A wrapping flex row sizes its items from `flex-basis` and then lets the last
 * row's stragglers GROW into the slack beside them. Photographed at 1328x744
 * on the merchant's five-card shelf: four cards at 145px and the fifth, alone
 * on its row, at 155. The same card, two sizes, on one shelf — the defect
 * CardSizeModel.js exists to argue against, reproduced by the layout rather
 * than by a stylesheet's number.
 *
 * Turning the growth off would fix the disagreement and cost the phone: with
 * `flex-grow: 0` a two-card row sits at the 120px floor with a hundred pixels
 * of slack beside it, where growing filled the row at 137. So neither half of
 * the CSS bargain is dropped. Instead the COLUMN COUNT stops being the
 * authored maximum and becomes the count this shelf actually holds at its
 * measured width — `cardShelfColumnsAt`, the model's own arithmetic — which
 * makes `calc((100% - (n - 1) * gap) / n)` the exact track. Every item on the
 * shelf then has the same basis, the row is full, and growth has nothing left
 * to distribute.
 *
 * Measure, then write, on the next frame: ResizeObserver delivers DURING
 * layout, and a custom property written there invalidates the box that is
 * being laid out. `wireShopLayout` in screens/shop.js keeps the same shape for
 * the same reason.
 *
 * EVERY PASS RE-FINDS THE SHELVES, and that is the correctness of the thing
 * rather than a tidiness. A caller that redraws — the mount service modal
 * replaces its whole preview, list and all, on every `update` — leaves the
 * wire holding a detached node; the new list is then never measured and falls
 * back to the root's authored maximum, in a modal whose own box never resizes,
 * so nothing ever comes along to correct it. So `apply` re-queries and observes
 * whatever it has not seen, and a caller that redraws only has to call it.
