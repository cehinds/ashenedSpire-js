// src/ui/components/hand.js — THE hand strip. One renderer, two surfaces.
//
// Until 2026-08-15 the hand was rendered TWICE: combat.js's template (the
// machinery — inspect hold, overlap arm, key hints, the mode word) and
// coop.js's own `.hand` (a snapshot-fed twin with none of it). That fork is
// how the co-op hand shipped at 27-device-px nodes' little sibling: no
// inspect hold, no overlap arm, an unscoped Law 5 exemption whose why-string
// named this collapse as the debt (Bjorn: "coop.js is two laws deep in
// undelivered fixes — the map then, the hand"). Same ruling as the map
// (mapboard.js): the STRIP is a property of the game — one renderer; WHO is
// looking supplies only viewer data. What is legitimately different per
// surface enters as parameters, never as a second template:
//
//   cards     — the viewer's list: { inst, preview?, affordable, reason?,
//               name?, selected? }. Solo passes live previewCard numbers off
//               the paced snapshot; co-op passes the host snapshot's hand
//               with a spelled-out unavailability reason (its player cannot
//               hover the engine for one).
//   wireCard  — what a card DOES. Solo wires local dispatch (drag,
//               click-to-target, self-arm); co-op wires network intents
//               (send playCard / arm an ally target). The strip itself never
//               plays a card — rendering and committing stay two hands.
//   emptyHtml — the viewer's empty state (co-op's spectator note). Solo never
//               renders a hand it cannot act in, so it passes nothing.
//
// Everything else — fan transform, z-order, key-hint badges (both surfaces
// honor 1-9/Q positionally), the inspect hold (armInspect BEFORE wireCard, in
// registration order, so a completed read can never become a play), the Law 5
// exemption (applied from its one home, src/ui/handAxis.js), and the OVERLAP
// arm of balance.ui.handLayout — is the strip's own truth and lives here once.
//
// THE OVERLAP ARM (C2), moved verbatim from combat.js:
// The word's one home is balance.ui.handLayout; main.js derives it onto
// <html data-hand-layout>; this module reads the ATTRIBUTE and nothing else.
// When the word is 'paging' (the default), the arm is inert and the render
// loop is byte-for-byte the shipped strip. Under 'overlap' on the narrow
// shape the whole hand lays inside the strip's own width: THE OVERLAP IS
// DERIVED, NEVER TYPED — measured container width, measured card width, hand
// size, so ten cards at Text XL fit exactly where five at S spread out.
// Law 5 clause 1 is the constraint the arithmetic serves: horizontal travel
// ZERO in this mode. The narrow fan is flattened on purpose: the exposed
// sliver of every card but the top IS its tap target, so it stays
// rectangular and measurable; the compensating reader is the inspect hold —
// which is exactly why the hold rides this component and not one caller: an
// overlap hand without its reader is the combination validateContent refuses.
//
// The word has no settings row, so mount-time is the exemption's lifetime —
// if a live toggle ever ships, callers must re-mount (or this must re-derive)
// on flip; the same warning rides handAxis.js.
