// src/ui/components/mapboard.js — THE ACT MAP. One renderer, mounted twice.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, and it is a collapse and not a repair.
//
// There were two act-map renderers in this tree: `ui/screens/map.js` and, eighty
// lines inside `ui/screens/coop.js`, a second one with its own `ROW_H = 46`, its
// own `y(floor)` and its own `r = boss ? 20 : 15` — the literals every other map
// number was derived away from on 2026-08-08. It imported neither map module, so
// none of that work reached it. Measured at dev `cd3da94`, 390x844, `?shot=`:
//
//                                        solo          co-op
//   node diameter, device px             44.09         27
//   at 320x640                           36.25         22.2
//   the tap-size setting 44 -> 24        (honest note) nothing moves
//   zoom controls                        3             0
//   camera                               fit + centre  scrollLeft 0
//   nodes off the side of the viewport   0 of 44       13 of 44
//   says what it drew (`data-framing`)   yes           no
//
// EVERY ROW OF THAT TABLE IS ONE FACT WRITTEN TWICE. Not a bug each: one bug,
// counted eight times, and the fix is not eight repairs — it is that the second
// copy stops existing.
//
// THE RULING THIS FILE IS SHAPED BY — ask what the predicate's subject is.
// "Is the co-op map a different map, or the same map with a second player on
// it?" It is the SAME MAP. The graph, the geometry, the radii solved from the
// tap floor, the zoom ladder, the camera, the fog rule and the act title are
// properties of THE ACT. They are not properties of who is looking at it.
//
// So the arguments are two, and the split is the ruling:
//
//   act     WHAT THE MAP IS.    Two clients that disagree about this are broken.
//   viewer  WHO IS LOOKING.     Two clients MUST disagree about this.
//
// WHAT MUST NEVER AGREE, said out loud because a collapse that does not name its
// exceptions is how a distinction gets lost:
//
//   1. `me`. Which vote is mine, which seat is mine, which node wears `my-vote`.
//      Two clients rendering the SAME snapshot must draw DIFFERENT pixels, or
//      the marking is a lie about whose choice it shows.
//   2. The camera. My zoom and my scroll position are mine. Nothing syncs them
//      and nothing should — a partner panning my map is not a feature.
//   3. WHO DECIDES WHAT I KNOW. In solo the client derives its own fog, because
//      the client IS the authority. In co-op the server is, and a client may
//      never widen what it was sent — which is why the snapshot ships `unknown`
//      instead of `event` and why this file never tries to lift that rung.
//      Same ladder, different hand on it, deliberately.
//
// Everything else is one home. Turn `ROW_H`, the tap default or the zoom ladder
// and both screens move together, which is the whole point: the act map is being
// re-laid for a phone next, and a re-layout that has to be done twice is a
// re-layout that will be done once.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT OWN. The chrome around the board — headers, party
// bars, hint bars, relic strips, the leave button — stays with its screen. This
// is the board, not the screen.

 *
 * IT LIVES HERE BECAUSE THE ZOOM IS THE VIEWER'S, NOT THE MAP'S. Two players
 * looking at one act have two zooms and that is correct. Moved out of
 * `ui/screens/map.js` unchanged so the co-op board honours the same preference

  // expression, and they had the same cause from opposite sides.
  //
  //   "the current node should be centered on the screen both vertically and
  //    horizontally"
  //   "for mobile, I should only be scrolling up and down, rarely left and
  //    right … rearrange things to keep everything visible in the vertical
  //    dimension"
  //
  // MEASURED AT dev (cd3da94), 390x844, the shipped default zoom: the scrollport
  // is 433x756 local px and the canvas was 834x775 — 401 px of scroll ACROSS,
  // the axis he has just banned, and 19 px DOWN, the axis he wants centred. The
  // vertical camera was not merely inaccurate, it was arithmetically impossible:
  // the entrance sits 293 px below the viewport centre and there were 19 px of
  // travel to close it with. Clamping (#…, my own last commit) made that
  // failure REPORTABLE. It could not make it succeed.
  //
  // BOTH NUMBERS COME FROM ONE MISTAKE: the scrollable area was `columns * COL_X
  // + 60` tall and wide — the shape of the ACT — while the shape of what is
  // DRAWN is 259 px wide under fog and the full 623 px of the climb tall. So the
  // player was given a canvas whose empty half was pannable and whose full half
  // was not.
  //
  // Both axes derive their extent from painted ink rather than the column grid.
  // Vertical always grows by half a viewport so every painted point can be
  // centred. With Two-axis map dragging on, horizontal does the same; with it
  // off, the horizontal content box is exactly the viewport and the viewBox is
  // centred on aimX, preserving the former vertical-only camera. This is viewBox

  // event — the browser clamps scrollTop to the new extent — and the debounce
  // below snapshots the camera, so the snapshot stamped the NEW measurements
  // onto a fit solved for the OLD ones. The map screen does re-fit a live board
  // on `resize` (map.js), but that is two animation frames away and lands on
  // whatever layout stage it catches; the clamp's scroll event does not wait

  // THE FOG ALREADY OBEYED THAT SENTENCE AND THE CAMERA THEN UNDID IT. The boss

  // has watched it go red — and the camera aimed at the door, which put the
  // boss 261 px above the top of a 390x844 screen on 12 of 12 seeds. Both
  // halves were doing their job. Nothing owned the sentence they add up to,
  // and `tools/actends.mjs` is the check that can now say so out loud: 0 of 24
  // cells at 89ec151, and — this is the part that is not about one branch —
  // 0 of 12 DESKTOP cells on `dev` before the camera changed at all.
  //
  // WHY THIS IS AIM AND NOT ZOOM. My own gate note said the two ends "span 692
  // local px against a 680 px port" and therefore needed ~2% of zoom-out on top
  // of the aim. THAT WAS A UNIT ERROR AND THE FIX IS SMALLER THAN I SAID: 692 is
  // LOCAL px (the map's own space, past `--ui-zoom`) and 680 is DEVICE px. In one
  // space it is 692 local against a 756-local port at 390x844 — it fits, with 64
  // px to spare, and aiming is the whole of it. Nothing here touches the zoom, so
  // the player's ladder is never overridden and no tap target shrinks.
  //
  // 1200x730 IS NOT THE SAME CAUSE AND IS DELIBERATELY NOT FIXED HERE. Same aim
  // defect, plus a second one underneath it: that port is 549 local px and the
  // ends span 692, so no aim can show both. Nor can any legal zoom — the ladder
  // floors at 100%, which still spans 603 px, and the zoom that WOULD fit (0.79)
  // delivers a 34 px map node against a 44 px tap floor. Showing both ends on a
  // 730-tall window is a LAYOUT question (that screen spends 165 px on chrome),
  // not a camera one, and it wants its own card rather than a camera that
  // quietly breaks the tap floor. So when the pair does not fit, this returns to
  // the shipped behaviour — the door centred — and SAYS SO in `data-entrance-*`
  // rather than failing the way it used to, which was silently.
  //
  // It is not in tension with "the current node should be centered on the screen
  // both vertically and horizontally": at the entrance there IS no current node.
  // The doors stand in for it, and the moment the player takes one step `cur`
  // exists and this function is never called again for that act.
  // AND THE ACT'S NAME IS PART OF THE ESTABLISHING SHOT, not a decoration on top
  // of it. My first draft framed the two ends and left `ACT I — THE FALLOW
  // MARCHES` HALF CUT BY THE TOP EDGE — photographed, 390x844, every seed: the
  // title's own band is y 99..119 device and the scrollport starts at 110. A
  // clipped word is worse than an absent one, and it is the same complaint that
  // put this whole task on the board. So the frame is chosen from a PREFERENCE
  // LADDER, widest first, and each rung is taken only if it fits at this zoom:
  //
  //   1. the title, the doors and the far end     the act, named, both ends
  //   2. the doors and the far end                his sentence, no caption
  //   3. the doors                                the shipped behaviour
  //
  // Rung 3 is what 1200x730 lands on and it is not a failure mode bolted on — it
  // is today's frame, unchanged, plus a camera that now says it missed.

  // NOTHING clamped the high end, and the browser clamped that silently. Asked
  // for scrollTop 263 it got 1, on 39 of 39 nodes at both shapes (Bjorn) — and
  // the function had no way to know, because a write it cannot read back is a
  // camera that cannot miss. Two fixes, and the second is the one that matters:
  //
  //   1. FIT, THEN CENTRE. The centroid was never wrong; the canvas was 834 px
  //      against a 390 viewport and nothing fitted the framing to the content.
  //      A box centre also beats a centroid — a centroid drifts toward whichever
  //      side has more nodes and pushes the lonely one off the edge.
  //   2. CLAMP OURSELVES, THEN SAY WHETHER IT WORKED. We compute the legal range
  //      and land inside it, so the browser has nothing left to correct, and
  //      then we measure the framing box against what is actually on screen and
  //      publish the answer (see `report`).
  //
  // AND WHAT CHANGED TONIGHT — Constantine, 2026-08-08: "the current node should
  // be centered on the screen both vertically and horizontally." The aim was the
  // BOX of the decision (current + every step out of it), which is the right
  // frame and is not what he asked for: the box centre sits about half a row
  // above the node the player is standing on, and at the entrance row the box IS
  // the door, so the camera aimed at a point the player was not. THE AIM IS NOW
  // THE CURRENT NODE ITSELF, and the entrances only stand in for it before the
  // first move, when there is no current node to aim at.
  //
  // It is exact on both axes now because `sizeSvg` gives it the travel (above),
  // not because the arithmetic here got smarter. The two halves are one change
  // and neither works alone.
  function centerOnCurrent() {
    // A hand on ⊙, on the zoom ladder, or a resize: this frame is the newer
    // instruction, so an in-flight glide stops rather than landing on top of it.

  // lands immediately, which is what reduced motion asks for.

  // AND THE HORIZONTAL HALF IS TWO DIFFERENT THINGS depending on who owns the
  // axis, which is the whole of #1168's tail. Vertical-only: the viewBox carries
  // the aim (`apply` solves `x0` from `aimX`) and the scroller has no horizontal
  // extent at all, so `scrollLeft` is 0 and saying so is honest. Two-axis — the
  // DEFAULT since MAP_FREE_PAN_DEFAULT — the viewBox is the whole ink plus half a
  // viewport of pad on each side and `scrollLeft` IS the horizontal camera. A
  // hardcoded 0 there is not "no pan", it is a pan to the far left of the padded
  // canvas: selecting a node threw the map into the right half of the screen
  // instead of centring on it. So the target carries `left` and it is tweened
  // like the other two; omit it and the old meaning (0) stands.
  //
  // AND A GLIDE IN FLIGHT OUTRANKED EVERY OTHER HAND ON THE CAMERA. Only
  // `glideTo` itself and `teardown` ever cancelled the frame, so anything that
  // wrote the camera DIRECTLY during the 300 ms after a pick was overwritten by
  // the next tween frame and the glide still landed on the picked node: ⊙ (or
  // `0`) read as doing nothing at all, `+` / `−` / ctrl-wheel re-centred and
  // were dragged back to a target solved at the OLD zoom, and a drag fought the
  // tween for every pixel. That is older than this change — and this change
  // sharpens it, because the tween now owns the horizontal axis for the whole
  // glide instead of only slamming it to 0 at the end. So the cancel gets a
  // name and the two doors that write the camera by hand use it: the computed

/**
 * attachParchment(host, path, w, h) — put the act's plate on the ground layer,

 *
 * The load is probed with a plain `Image`, not by inserting the `<image>` and
 * hoping: a decode failure then costs nothing, because nothing was ever added to
 * the document. Fire-and-forget by design — a plate that arrives 40 ms after the
 * map does is a background fading in; a map that waits for one is a map that
 * never opens when the file is absent.
 *
 * No `onerror` on purpose: the absent plate is the SHIPPING state today, and a
 * console warning per map mount would be noise about a thing everyone knows. The
 * moment the files exist, a missing one is a 404 in the network panel.
