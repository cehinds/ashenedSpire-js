// src/ui/components/holdconfirm.js — THE SECOND BEAT, in both its forms.
//
// Constantine, asked whether to build it: "yes press and hold" — and the same
// sentence ended "same with ending turn."
//
// WHAT THIS FILE IS NOW, AND WHY IT CHANGED. It used to export `armHold` and
// nothing else, and `armHold` had exactly ONE caller in the whole tree: the
// event screen. That is how the second half of his sentence was lost — not by
// anyone deciding End Turn should commit on a tap, but because giving a second
// action a second beat meant REMEMBERING A SECOND CALL. Marina's ruling, and it
// is the design of this module:
//
//     WHICH ACTIONS TAKE A SECOND BEAT IS A CHARACTERISTIC ON THE ACTION,
//     NEVER A LIST OF CALL SITES.
//
// So `beatArmer` is the door now, and no screen picks an interaction. A screen
// names its action and hands over the commit; `model/secondbeat.js` retains the
// stakes/hazard classification, while this file applies the universal option
// contract: tap reviews in the shared modal, deliberate hold commits directly.
// A screen CANNOT wire a
// hold to something the table has not ruled on — `beatFor` throws on an unknown
// id — and it cannot quietly skip one either, because the control it draws
// marks itself and an instrument reads the page back against the table.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// TWO FORMS ON EVERY ROUTED OPTION, BECAUSE THEY SERVE TWO PLAYER INTENTS.
//
//   HOLD  — the experienced player deliberately approves without leaving the
//           original control. The fill exposes progress and early release aborts.
//   CONFIRM — the short activation opens the shared modal, showing the exact
//           change and optional costs before the player approves it.
//
// THE FIVE THINGS THE HOLD MUST NEVER DO, each one a way this shape goes wrong:
//
//   1. COMMIT ON A RELEASE. Releasing early is the abort, so a pointer `click`
//      on a held control NEVER commits — the completed hold is the only pointer
//      path there is. Get this backwards and the safety feature becomes a
//      second way to fire the thing.
//   2. COMMIT TWICE. It fires the instant the fill lands, then disarms; the
//      trailing pointerup and its click find nothing armed.
//   3. BE A MOUSE FEATURE. THE DIAL IS THE SWITCH AND IT GOVERNS EVERY INPUT.
//      Constantine, 2026-08-17: "if hold is toggled, then it should be the
//      same, in all instances. for ending turn, using flask, event choice,
//      shrine rest." So `balance.ui.holdConfirm` — the dial that already
//      existed — is the one switch, and when it is on, every one of those four
//      actions holds on pointer, keyboard AND gamepad. When it is `off`, the
//      shortcut is disabled and all three inputs still open the review modal.
//      There is no per-input or per-action interaction rule left to drift.
//
//      WHAT IT REPLACED, kept because the reasoning was good and is no longer
//      the ruling. This form used to refuse every non-pointer source on the
//      argument that it answers a POINTING failure — a 9 px gap only a finger
//      can fall into — and a focus cursor selects a NAMED element and cannot
//      mis-point. True, and beside the point his sentence settles: he asked for
//      one dial with one meaning, not for the beat to be owed only where the
//      hazard is. His word outranks the derivation; the derivation is recorded
//      here rather than deleted, because the cost is real — a pad player who
//      cannot mis-point now pays 600 ms per End Turn, and `off` is where they
//      go.
//
//      MEASURED AT b83bda1, 390x844, dial `normal`, before this act — the
//      breach was EIGHT cells, not one:
//        endTurn      key `e` tap  turn 1 -> 2   ·  pad btn2 tap  turn 1 -> 2
//        eventChoice  Enter tap    3 bars -> 1   ·  pad btn0 tap  3 bars -> 1
//        useFlask     Enter tap    hpCurrent 2 -> 1 · pad btn0 tap  2 -> 1
//        shrineRest   Enter tap    shrine gone   ·  pad btn0 tap  shrine gone
//      Every pointer cell aborted correctly in the same run.
//
//      AND "THE FIX IS ONE LINE" — the sentence this comment used to carry —
//      WAS WRONG, in the two ways a reader could not see from here:
//        (a) `.end-turn` matches input.js's CHROME list, so THE FOCUS CURSOR
//            CANNOT REACH IT. Enter and pad-Confirm never arrive at End Turn at
//            all; its keyboard door is `e`, a `kind: 'key'` binding that reaches
//            the button as a synthetic click. Deleting the source guard alone
//            would have changed nothing whatsoever for the one action with a
//            measured live breach behind it. The other half of this act is in
//            ui/input.js: a `key`-kind action that has an armed control presses
//            it through the same door instead of clicking it.
//        (b) `onEnd` returned nothing, and input.js reads that return as "did
//            the gesture consume the activation?". With only the guard deleted,
//            an ABORTED key hold would have activated on release (the abort
//            commits — rule 1, inverted) and a COMPLETED one would have fired
//            at full and then activated again on release. Watched, both.
//   4. TRAP A SCROLL. Moving more than SLOP px abandons, so a drag that was
//      trying to scroll the screen never becomes a commit.
//   5. GO INVISIBLE. The fill is state, not decoration, so it survives
//      reduced-motion; it is a width driven per frame, not an animation.
//
// Cancellation is not hand-rolled: armPress / trackGesture (#22, ui/gesture.js)
// calls onEnd exactly once however the gesture ended — pointerup, pointercancel,
// palm rejection, focus loss, a key or pad button coming back up — pointerId-
// scoped on the pointer path, listeners on the element, nothing on window. Vira
// measured the hole that module exists to fill; a hold that reinvented it would
// reinvent the hole.
//
// AND NEITHER FORM BINDS `pointerdown` ANY MORE, which is the S7 fix in one
// sentence: both go through `armPress`, the ONE door a press-shaped gesture
// begins at, and that door has pointer, keyboard and gamepad behind it. A form
// that wants a hold gets all three by construction; a form that refuses one says
// so on a line of its own. NEITHER FORM REFUSES ONE ANY MORE (rule 3 above).
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE SEAM FOR VEGA — a hold with no feedback is a gesture you cannot tell is
// working, and I am not the seat who authors sound.
//
// Hold boundaries deliberately make no sound here. Vega's hold-beat observer
// owns `data-hold` / `data-hold-progress` and is the one sound path for start,
// progress, completion and abort. Confirm panels are a different form with no
// hold transition, so their three cues remain here without double-firing.

// THE INSPECT FORM — press-and-hold to READ, and it is deliberately not a beat.
//
// Constantine, 2026-08-08: hold a card and it "expands" and comes "in front".
// This is the gesture half of that ask, built against the hand as it ships;
// the LAYOUT half (overlap vs paging — C2) is held and lands on top of this
// later without touching it.
//
// WHY IT LIVES IN THIS FILE AND IS NOT A ROW IN model/secondbeat.js. The table
// rules on COMMITS — what a mis-press writes. An inspect writes nothing:
// stakes `nothing`, and the table's own derivation already answers `none` for
// that. So it takes no row, calls no `beatFor`, and no control marks itself
// `data-beat` for it. What it SHARES with the hold form is the machinery —
// SLOP, trackGesture's lifecycle, the fire-at-full shape — which is why it is
// a neighbour and not a copy.
//
// WHY IT IS SILENT, and this is Vega's call to make and sign. Three reasons,
// each sufficient:
//   1. The hold-beat phrase (holdbeat.js) is authored to MEAN "an irreversible
//      commit is approaching" — the accelerating train, the arrival note. An
//      inspect commits nothing, so playing that phrase here would teach the
//      arrival note a second meaning and the cue would start lying about
//      system state on the controls where it matters.
//   2. Frequency. Inspecting is reading; it will fire more than any hold in
//      the game. The cost of a charming sound is paid at hold #200.
//   3. Unlike End Turn, the confirmation is not occluded: the expanded card is
//      most of the screen and nowhere near the thumb. The eye already has it.
// So: no BEAT_CUES entry, no `data-hold` (holdbeat.js filters on that name and
// stays silent), its own attributes. If a soft page-turn is ever wanted, it is
// one `sfx.play` at ONE call site — `open()` below — and Sunna's read decides,
// not this comment.
//
// WHAT IT PUBLISHES, because an instrument and a screenshot must read the
// gesture without becoming its finger: `data-inspect` = idle | pending | open,
// and `data-inspect-progress` while pending. A mid-hold check reads the
// attribute; it never has to time a camera against a 400 ms window.
//
// THREE INPUTS, ONE GESTURE (S7) — added 2026-08-17, and the defect it closed
// was an accessibility one: a player who could not use a pointer could not READ
// A CARD. Measured at b968e28, the focus cursor on a hand card, Enter held 750 ms
// against a 400 ms dial: `data-inspect` never left `idle`, zero copies, and the
// card was SELECTED on keydown. The gesture now begins at `armPress`
// (ui/gesture.js), so a held Confirm key and a held Confirm pad button run the
// same timer, the same fill, the same fire-at-full and the same restore as a
// finger. What differs, and only this: a focus cursor has no coordinates, so the
// origin is the control's own centre and the 12 px boundary below can never fire
// — there is no drag to yield to and no scroll to trap. Watched red per input
// (tools/inspecthold.mjs P3/P4/P5).
//
// DISAMBIGUATION AGAINST TAP AND DRAG — one shared boundary, one timer:
//   move > SLOP px, any time  -> a DRAG (or the narrow hand's pan-x scroll).
//                                The inspect abandons silently; whoever owns
//                                drags proceeds. Same 12 px the drag itself
//                                uses to start, so there is no gap band.
//   still, release < ms       -> a TAP. The click passes through untouched.
//   still, past ms            -> the INSPECT. Expands at full, front, under
//                                the finger; RELEASE closes it and the click
//                                that follows is swallowed exactly once —
//                                a completed read must never become a play.
//   once open, movement STILL abandons the read — the boundary above says "any
//   time" and now means it. It did not: the abandon was scoped to `pending`,
//   and since the timer starts at pointerdown, ANY press slower than the dial
//   to its first 12 px (a hesitation, or simply aiming slowly) opened the read
//   and then never yielded it. Constantine reported the visible half of that
//   ("if a card is selected and the enemy is highlighted, I can't drag the
//   card on the enemy to use it"); measured at 5 shapes, 5/5 dead. The caller
//   still refuses to start a drag while `data-inspect="open"` (combat does),
//   and that is now a backstop rather than the mechanism.
//   WHAT THAT GUARD PROTECTED STILL HOLDS, and it is watched at both edges: a
//   13 px reading DRIFT commits nothing, because a drift ends in the hand and
//   `.hand-area` is not `.field` (siblings; combat's drop needs
//   `closest('.field')`). Crossing 12 px and then carrying the card onto the
//   battlefield is not a drift — it is the drag this boundary exists to name.
//
// LAW 4 / RESTORE: the expanded copy is `pointer-events: none`, steals no
// focus, covers no tap floor it can eat, and release removes it entirely —
// the hand under it is byte-for-byte untouched. On cancel (browser claims the
// gesture) the click swallow is NOT armed — no click follows a cancel, and a
// stale swallow eats the next real tap (Vira's F3, learned once already).

/**
 * reveal(panel, actions) — bring a freshly-opened confirm panel ON SCREEN.
 *
 * ⚠ WHY THIS EXISTS, AND THE MEASUREMENT IS THE WHOLE ARGUMENT. The panel is
 * inserted `afterend` of the control it asks about, so where it LANDS is decided
 * by however tall the screen above it happens to be. At `db09846`, tapping a
 * Smith candidate put both answers at
 *
 *     390x844   .beat-yes / .beat-no  top 1000.22 .. 1044.22   0% on screen
 *     360x640   .beat-yes / .beat-no  top  938.66 ..  982.66   0% on screen
 *
 * — 156 px and 299 px below the fold respectively (`node tools/uprightgate.mjs`,
 * both shapes, and `tools/holdconfirm.mjs` red on two cells because a CDP touch
 * at y=1022 lands on nothing).
 *
 * IT IS A LEGIBILITY DEFECT AND NOT A STRANDING, and getting that distinction
 * right cost two seats a measurement each. I read `document.scrollHeight === 844`
 * and concluded the panel could not be answered at all. **The DOCUMENT does not
 * scroll; `.screen` does** — `overflow-y: auto`, real travel — so the player CAN
 * reach it, by scrolling 156 px that nothing on the screen advertises (Vira
 * re-measured on `b30e624` and corrected my conclusion while confirming my
 * position; the reach word her probe prints is `scrollable`, not `unreachable`).
 * A question the player has to go looking for is not a question, so this scrolls
 * it into view for them.
 *
 * NEAREST, NOT CENTRE, AND NOT SMOOTH. `block: 'nearest'` is the least scroll
 * that makes the thing visible, which keeps the ARMED CARD — `.beat-armed`, one
 * row above — on screen with it: the player must be able to see which card the
 * question is about, and a centred or `start` scroll pushes it off. Instant
 * rather than smooth because a 300 ms animation is a window in which the buttons
 * are still off screen and a fast second tap lands on nothing, and because a
 * reduced-motion player is owed no animation at all.
 *
 * THE PANEL FIRST, THE ANSWERS SECOND, AND THE SECOND CALL IS NOT BELT-AND-BRACES.
 * A panel TALLER than the viewport cannot be brought wholly into view, and
 * `nearest` on the panel would align its TOP — leaving the buttons, which are at
 * its bottom, exactly where they were. So the actions row is asked for after the
 * panel, and it is the one that must win. At Text XL on a 360x640 phone the
 * question, the preview and a wrapped button row are what make that reachable
 * rather than hypothetical.
 *
 * NOTHING IS POSITIONED. This is a scroll, not a placement: the panel keeps the
 * rect the stylesheet gave it, and Law 2's container/coordinate rules have no
 * new subject. That also means the fix is INVISIBLE to any probe that refuses to
 * scroll on principle — see the note in tools/uprightgate.mjs, whose whole
 * reason for clicking through the Smith by hand is that it will not
 * scrollIntoView a target itself. Its clause R gates `unreachable` only, so it
 * was GREEN on this defect and is GREEN on this fix; the cells that can tell the
 * two apart are in tools/holdconfirm.mjs.

 *
 * THE ONE DOOR. A screen calls this once, then names actions. It never names a
 * form, never reads the dial twice, and cannot arm something the table has not
 * ruled on.
 *
 * opts:
 *   ctx          the action's state, for a row whose characteristics depend on
 *                it. A key the row declares and the caller omits THROWS by name
 *                (secondbeat.js) rather than resolving to a plausible 'none'.
 *   onConfirm    the commit. Called once, whichever form ran.
 *   question     confirm form only — the sentence above the buttons.
 *   detailHtml   confirm form only — what the action actually does.
 *   confirmLabel confirm form only.
 *   hintHost     where the HOLD word goes, when the armed control is a FIXED
 *                box that cannot hold it. `armHold` has always taken this; the
 *                door dropped it, so a shop card got the hint appended INSIDE
 *                the kit's card — which clips its own overflow, and the word
 *                came out as half a line of letters (photographed at 390x844).
 *                A screen naming a host is not naming a form; the hint's
 *                placement is the caller's geometry, and only the caller knows
 *                which of its elements is the one with room.
 *   hintBefore   the child of that host to insert the hint before (default:
 *                appended last).
 *
 * EVERY ARMED CONTROL MARKS ITSELF, including the ones that owe no beat:
 * `data-beat="none|hold|confirm"` and `data-beat-action="<id>"`. That is not
 * decoration — it is the only way an instrument can read the page back against
 * the table IN BOTH DIRECTIONS: a declared action that draws no control is a
 * lie, and a control whose action nobody declared is a gap. Neither is visible
 * from a source tree.
