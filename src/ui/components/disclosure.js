// src/ui/components/disclosure.js — THE FACE / REVEAL RENDERER.
//
// D26. The words are model/disclosure.js; this is the one thing that draws
// them, so the creation screen and (by the handover packet, 2026-08-16) the F1
// combat frame render entries with one renderer instead of two that agree
// today. Two hand renderers cost this house a whole act once already.
//
// WHAT IT DRAWS, per group:
//
//   .disc-faces      the row of FACES — one control per entry whose own
//                    `disclosure` says 'face'. A face is a <button>: name and
//                    number, no prose, tap floor on both axes.
//   .disc-more       present ONLY when the data puts at least one entry behind
//                    it. Its count is the count — never a typed number — and
//                    when every entry is face-tier the control does not exist,
//                    because an expander that opens nothing is a lie about
//                    there being more.
//   .disc-reveal     ONE panel, holding the open entry: title, the authored
//                    sentence, the derived lines, and the RECEIPT last. One at
//                    a time on purpose — the short form stays short, and a
//                    phone that opens five sentences is the screen he asked us
//                    to stop shipping. It opens UNDER THE ROW THE TAPPED FACE
//                    IS ON — see WHERE IT OPENS, below.
//
// WHERE IT OPENS (MR-287, 2026-08-16). Constantine, on the shipped build:
// "in character creation, I would slect an item and instead of expanding under
// the ubtton it shows up at hte bottom for all of them as if I expanded the
// bottom button". He is describing this file. The panel used to be the NEXT
// SIBLING of `.disc-faces` — one fixed spot, after every face — so on any host
// whose faces occupy more than one line, a face on an earlier line opened a
// panel lines away from itself. Measured at 9d7764f, headless Chromium, the
// gap from the tapped face's bottom edge to the panel's top edge:
//
//   390x844   stats host    54.78 px on all five attribute faces (row 1 of 2)
//             armament host 153.56 / 104.17 / 54.78 px on rows 1-3 of 4
//   1200x730  stats host    56 px on eight of nine faces (rows 1-2 of 3)
//             armament host 156 / 106 / 56 px on rows 1-3 of 4
//
//   8 of 13 faces adrift at 390x844, 11 of 13 at 1200x730 — and the armament
//   host is the worse of the two per row, because every one of its faces is a
//   full-width line, so a four-row host has three wrong answers and one right
//   one. Both hosts, not one.
//
// THE PANEL IS NOW A ROW OF `.disc-faces` ITSELF — a `flex: 1 1 100%` item
// moved to just after the last face sharing the tapped face's line. The wrap
// then does the work: the panel lands on the line below, and the space between
// them is the container's OWN `row-gap`. That is the whole of it, and the
// reason it is done this way rather than by positioning: THE SEPARATION IS
// DERIVED, NOT TYPED. `tools/creationbrief.mjs` (MR-287) measures the gap
// against `getComputedStyle('.disc-faces').rowGap` read off the layout, so a
// panel placed by arithmetic would need a JS constant that agrees with a
// stylesheet number — a second copy of one fact, which is Law 0 clause 4 and
// the defect this house exists to catch. A flex row cannot disagree with its
// own container's gap.
//
// AND IT ONLY WORKS IF THE FACES ARE ON MORE THAN ONE LINE — the placement is a
// choice between siblings, so a row whose faces all share a line has exactly one
// place to put the panel, and that place is the bottom. Constantine, 2026-09-05,
// on the shipped build: "when class is selected, the class selection should be
// under it. same with character, starting equipment too. isntead it just shows
// up at hte bottom". The renderer had not moved; the stylesheet had. The kit
// sweep of 2026-09-04 put `.as-options.flow > .as-option { flex: 1 1 auto }`
// (three classes) above `.disc-face.disc-pick { flex: 1 1 100% }` (two), so
// every face of the creation screen computed `1 1 auto` and all four sections
// sat on ONE line at top=77 (measured, headless Chromium 1200x730). The fix is
// in styles/kit.css, at the rule that says so; NOTHING IN THIS FILE COULD HAVE
// FIXED IT, and that is worth knowing before reading the placement again.
//
// NOT DONE, and it was the instruction I was given: `place(anchor)` from
// components/tooltip.js was NOT extracted and wired here. Three reasons, and
// the first is the one that would have shipped a worse screen than the defect:
//   1. `place()` positions a `position: fixed` element against the VIEWPORT.
//      This panel is click-persistent inside `.cz-scroll`, which scrolls. A
//      tooltip gets away with the viewport because it dies on pointerleave; a
//      panel that stays open would detach from its face on the first scroll.
//      (Reasoned from `position: fixed`, not measured — named as reasoning.)
//   2. `place()` answers "beside it" — right, left, below, above, first that
//      fits — and at 1200x730 there is room to the right of most faces, so it
//      would open the panel BESIDE the face. He asked for *under the button*.
//   3. There was no second copy to collapse. Neither host places anything by
//      hand: both call one renderer, this one, and this one placed nothing.
//      Extracting `place()` would have ADDED a caller, not removed one. The
//      shared coordinate/clamp arithmetic already has one home in `ui/fx.js`.
//
// A LIVE REVEAL — the same mechanism, folding a PICKER instead of words.
// Constantine, 2026-08-16: "go ahead and allow the fold" (MR-151: default
// folded, expandable, D26's own mechanism applied to more items). An entry may
// hand this renderer a NODE (`reveal.node`) rather than a sentence: a picker
// that already exists on the screen and carries its own listeners. The renderer
// ADOPTS it — once, at mount, into the same one panel — and the fold is that
// panel's `hidden`. It never re-draws it, because re-drawing it is how a screen
// grows a second renderer.
//
// THIS BRANCH IS THREE LINES AND IT IS WHY THERE IS NO SECOND FILE. The
// creation screen's KEEPSAKE / SIGIL / TINT / SPRITE rows fold by the same
// face, the same tap, and the same published state as D26's stat entries.
// tools/handrenderers.mjs is already counting what a second hand renderer cost
// this house; tools/onefold.mjs counts the same debt here, and goes red on a
// planted second one.
//
// AND A FOLDED PICKER STILL NAMES WHAT IS CHOSEN. A face is a label AND a
// value — that is the contract the stat faces already keep, and a fold whose
// face said only SIGIL would hide the one thing a folded row exists to report.
// `setValue(key, value)` is how the screen keeps it true after a tap; the
// markup for a face lives in ONE place (faceHtml) so the two paths cannot
// drift into two shapes.
//
// HOW IT OPENS, and no second gesture is minted (model/disclosure.js says why):
//   TAP the face      → its reveal. Tap it again → closed. This is the whole
//                       affordance and it is the one a thumb already has.
//   HOVER / GP FOCUS  → the same words in the shared tooltip. A pointer and the
//                       pad get the tip for free; neither is required to read.
//
// WHAT IT PUBLISHES, so an instrument and a screenshot can read the state
// without becoming the finger (armInspect's rule, applied here):
//   data-face="<key>"        on every face, the model's own entry key
//   data-disclosure="face|reveal"  the tier the ENTRY declared, echoed as
//                            drawn — an instrument compares this against the
//                            content table and catches a screen that ignored it
//   aria-expanded + data-reveal="open|closed"  on the face
//   data-reveal-for="<key>"  on the panel while it is open
//
// REMOVAL CONDITION: deleted with model/disclosure.js — it has no other job.

// A FOLD INSIDE A FOLD IS MOUNTED AND OPENED WHILE ITS HOST IS OFF THE GLASS,

// screen's CHARACTER and STARTING EQUIPMENT panels are `display: none` — stashed
// by the outer fold — at the moment the folds inside them mount and open, and
// `renderEquipment()` re-mounts the equipment fold on every class change with
// that panel still shut. Every rect placeUnderRow could read is then ZERO, no
// sibling starts a later line, and the panel is appended after the last face:
// the bottom. Measured at d51b46a, 1200x730: `#cz-character-fold` and
// `#cz-equipment-fold` both reported every face at top=0, width=0.
//
// So the placement is RE-DERIVED the moment the host is back on the glass,
// rather than remembered from a measurement that could not be taken. Each mount
// registers its own re-placer here, and opening a panel re-places every fold
// that panel just revealed. `reflow` is open()'s placement step called again on
// a laid-out host — not a second copy of it, and not an arithmetic that predicts
