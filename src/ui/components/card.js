  // This was wrong twice, and on the one face that matters most it was wrong
  // silently. `chip.offsetTop` is measured from the chip's OFFSET PARENT, and
  // WC0 makes `.ctags` `position: absolute` (kit.css) — so on a playing card
  // the strip IS that offset parent and chip tops already start at 0. The old
  // line subtracted `tags.offsetTop`, which is measured from `.art` instead, so
  // every position came out negative, nothing ever cleared the `>= 2` test, and
  // the `+N` deferral NEVER FIRED on a combat card. The rows past the second
  // were then cut off by `.ctags`'s own `overflow: hidden` with no ellipsis and
  // no scroller. Measured at c63a09620, ?shot=combat, 1200x730: Guard Counter's
  // strip was 78 px of content in a 36 px box — 42 px of a card's subtypes
  // gone, and `data-tag-rows` reporting 0 for a five-chip card at 390x844.
  //
  // Second: the pitch. `chip.offsetHeight + 2` assumed a 2 px gap while the
  // stylesheet's is `0.3rem` (3 px at the shipped 10px root), so a row cost 20
  // px and the arithmetic charged 19 — a drift that grows with every row. There
  // is no need to divide at all: chips on one row share an offsetTop, so the
  // DISTINCT tops in order ARE the rows.
