// src/ui/components/buildstamp.js — THE ONE RENDERER of the build stamp.
//
// Constantine asked for the build version on three surfaces (main menu, map,
// combat). Three surfaces is three chances to type the same markup three ways,
// and this house has paid for that twice already in bigger things — two map
// renderers (ui/components/mapboard.js), two hand renderers. So the string has
// one home (src/buildversion.js) and its MARKUP has one home, here.
//
// WHY IT CARRIES `data-role` RATHER THAN LEANING ON ITS CLASS. A class is a
// styling hook and any stylesheet may take it away; the role is what the
// photograph gate looks for (tools/buildstamp-shot.mjs), and a gate keyed to a
// styling hook goes quiet the day someone renames the hook.
//
// AND `data-place` IS NOT DECORATION. It is how the gate proves there are
// THREE placements rather than one element photographed three times.
//
// ONE THING THIS CANNOT DO, and it is written here so nobody reads the class as
// a promise: being in the DOM is not being on the screen. `opacity: 0`,
// `visibility: hidden`, a colour equal to the panel behind it, `height: 0` and
// a narrow-layout `display: none` all leave this element exactly where it is
// (Vira's finding on `UNMOVED AND UNEXPLAINED`, 2026-08-15). That is why the
// gate measures INK inside this element's box and not its presence — and why
// styles/ui.css keeps `.build-stamp` out of every narrow-layout hide rule
// deliberately rather than by luck.
//
// THE SENTENCE IT SPEAKS ON HOVER GOES THROUGH THE ONE TOOLTIP SERVICE
// (components/tooltip.js), never a `title=` attribute — the house's one rule
// for tooltips. The stamp is built as a string by string-building screens, so
// the wiring is this module's own: after any placement is written, the next
// microtask finds every unwired stamp on the page and attaches its tooltip.
// One home for the markup, one for the sentence, one for the hover.
