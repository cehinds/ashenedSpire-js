 * `.flask-action-menu` had no rule in any stylesheet, so the root below was
 * `position: static`, appended last to `.combat` / `.mapscreen`, and it rendered
 * as a full-width strip on the bottom edge — 567 local px below its own control
 * at 1200x730, 726.9 at 390x844, its Inspect row 39% buried under the DRAW pile.
 * Constantine reported it; Bjorn photographed it and corrected the wording;
 * Sunna placed it. The before/after numbers and the reason `under` beat `beside`
 * are in `.flask-action-menu`'s block in styles/ui.css — the placement's costs
 * are a design record and they live with the design, not in two files.
 *
 * WHY THE WORDING MATTERED, kept because the lesson outlives the defect: gating
 * d705b66 this docstring was cited as evidence that the menu wants no anchored
 * placement, and Marina's relay that it DOES want one was scored wrong on the
 * strength of it. NO SEARCH FOR PLACEMENT CODE CAN FIND A SURFACE WHOSE DEFECT
 * IS THAT IT PLACES NOTHING. The artifact wins over the comment about it. — Bjorn

 * The check is tools/placement.mjs P5, at both shapes, through the real tap.
