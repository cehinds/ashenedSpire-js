// src/ui/surfaces.js — every navigable set, and the join to its handler.
//
// EldenSpire#78. Bjorn found the same defect three times in shipped code:
// VOCABULARY IN DATA, HANDLER IN CODE, NOTHING CHECKING THEY AGREE. A new
// armoury view rendered as hybrid; a new overlay tab showed an empty panel; a
// new settings category was a lone heading. Not one of them errored — the author
// did the data-driven thing correctly and got a broken screen (Law 0 clause 5).
//
// THIS FILE HOLDS NO MEMBERS. That is the whole design. Each row below points at
// the one home its set already has and asks it, at call time, so this table can
// never be a second copy of anything — the failure mode Marina named when she
// refused to split #78: *a new home nobody validates is a second copy waiting
// for its first disagreement.* What lives here is the pair no single file could
// hold: WHAT IS DECLARED and WHAT WILL HANDLE IT.
//
// Two of the three receipts needed no join in the end, and that is the better
// half of the answer:
//
//   armoury views      the handler DISSOLVED. A view row now says what it is
//                      (figure? slots flanking or listed?) and both the screen
//                      and the stylesheet read those. Nothing anywhere knows the
//                      word "grid". `resolve` here only checks the row is
//                      written in the vocabulary the screen actually has — and
//                      THAT VOCABULARY IS THE COMBINATION, not each field.
//                      Declaring two characteristics closed separately left a
//                      cell of their product legal and undrawn, which rendered
//                      an EMPTY armoury in silence (Vira, gate of 5c49fed).
//                      A closed set must stay closed under whatever
//                      factorisation replaces it — Marina, and it is house-wide.
//   settings categories the DECLARATION dissolved. A category exists because a
//                      row is filed under it. What is still authored is the
//                      order — and an ordered name nothing files under is what
//                      fails below.
//   overlay tabs       neither dissolves, honestly: a panel is code and there is
//                      no vocabulary in which "the deck grid" is a row. So the
//                      tab's id IS the key into PANELS, one name not two, and a
//                      row without its function fails HERE, at boot, by name.
//
// WHAT THIS CANNOT DO, said out loud: it cannot see a fifth navigable set that
// nobody adds a row for. Nothing in a source tree can. That hole is answered on
// the rendered page instead — every set marks its host `data-surface="<id>"` and
// each control `data-member="<member>"`, so an instrument enumerates what the
// game actually drew rather than what it was told to expect. ALL FOUR SETS MARK
// THEMSELVES NOW; `menuAct` did not, and it was the one set whose worst edge —
// an act declared here that no context implements — is ONLY visible on the page.
// The attributes are a CONVENTION, not a derivation: a set nobody registers is a
// set nobody marks, and nothing checks the two agree. Saying so is the point.
//
// ---- A SET IS A LIST OF HOMES (Vira, re-gate of #78) ------------------------
//
// The first pass gave each row ONE `members()` and one prose `home`. When
// `overlayTab` grew a second home — MENU_TABS DECLARES the strip, a MENU row's
// `tab:` NAVIGATES to it — `members()` quietly became a union of the two and the
// zero-member guard was left counting the union. So an entire home could go
// empty and the check still reported full coverage: `MENU_TABS = []` and the tab
// strip declares nothing, the folded switcher has nothing, Law 3's bumper ring
// has nothing to cycle, and the member count drops 6 → 5 with the verdict `OK`.
// A SHRINKING DENOMINATOR WITH A GREEN VERDICT. Vira's property, and it is
// Marina's own one turn on:
//
//     A GUARD PROVEN OVER ONE HOME MUST BE RE-PROVEN WHEN THE SET GAINS A SECOND.
//
// So a row no longer says where its members come from in prose beside a function
// that goes and gets them. IT LISTS ITS HOMES, each with its own `members()`,
// and BOTH the member list and the `home` sentence are DERIVED from that list.
// The guard runs per home. This is written for the class rather than for the tab
// strip — `armouryView` and `menuAct` have one home each today and are the same
// shape, so the day either of them is widened the guard widens with it and
// nobody has to remember. A one-home set behaves exactly as it did.
//
// The line it draws is Law 0 clause 2 in miniature: THE HOMES ARE THE
// VOCABULARY AND THE MEMBERS ARE THE DATA. Emptying a home is a data edit and
// must fail by name; removing a home is a code edit here, reviewed like any
// other word. That is why "every declared home declares at least one member" is
// not too strict — the alternative is a home that exists in this file and
// nowhere else, which is the second copy this table was built to refuse.

 * a failure that dies before the validator runs is still this clause's.
 *
 * WHY IT IS HERE AND NOT SIX GUARDS. `viewIds()` guards its own read and the
 * other five homes do not, which is the inconsistency that let this through.
 * The cure is not to copy that guard five times — five copies of one guard is
 * the defect this table exists to refuse, and `(x || [])` only answers `null`

 * cannot be read is a FACT ABOUT THE HOME**, so it belongs where every other
 * fact about a home now lives: in the per-home report, named, alongside
 * *declares ZERO members*. One guard, at the one place that reads homes,
 * covering every shape of unreadable rather than the one shape someone guessed.
 *
 * And it wraps `resolve` and `fix` for the same reason, unasked: the finding was

 * promising the guard in a docstring it no longer gave).
 *
 * DUPLICATES ARE PER HOME TOO, and for the mirror-image reason: the same tab
