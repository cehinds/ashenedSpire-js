// src/ui/debuglog.js — in-game command log (Settings → Advanced → Command log).
//
// A ring buffer of everything the UI asks the engine to do and everything that
// comes back: dispatches, rejections, ignored inputs, timeline lifecycle, and
// uncaught page errors. Exists so a stuck game can be diagnosed from inside the
// game — open the log, read the last commands, copy them into a bug report.
//
// THIS MODULE IS A LEAF, AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING: fx.js imports `dlog`,
// tooltip.js imports fx.js, the shell imports tooltip.js and the kit
// re-exports the shell — so this file may not import the kit, or the graph
// closes into a loop that tools/bundle.mjs evaluates in one order (tooltip
// before fx: `viewportLocalBox is not a function` in the shipped bundle).
// The chrome — the failure banner as the kit's Blocker, the viewer as a lg
// door — lives in ui/components/debugChrome.js and registers itself here
// through registerDebugChrome(); main.js imports that module once. Until it
// has, a banner still stands (plain DOM wearing the kit's classes) — a
// failure at boot must never wait for chrome.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A CONTROL THAT STOPS WORKING TELLS SOMEONE
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The ☰ button died and the game said nothing. Measured on six channels at
// once: the TypeError is REAL and it IS emitted — CDP Runtime.exceptionThrown,
// a page `error` listener installed before navigation, the same listener
// installed after load, and the log below all carry it, identically over
// http:// and over the file:// bundle. Nothing swallows it and no listener is
// late. It is invisible to exactly two audiences, and they are the two that
// matter: THE PLAYER, who sees no change at all, and EVERY INSTRUMENT THIS
// HOUSE OWNS — not one tool in tools/ subscribes to an error channel.
//
// The game already captured it. This file has held the `error` listener below
// since long before anyone looked. THE RECORD WAS THERE THE WHOLE TIME, AND THE
// ONLY DOOR TO IT WAS THE THING THAT BROKE: mid-run, Settings → Advanced →
// Command log is reachable only through the overlay, because `onSettings` is
// handed to mountMap and mountCombat and read by neither. When the overlay is
// the control that died, the account of why it died is behind it.
//
// SO THE FIX IS NOT A FOURTH SUBSCRIBER. It is one banner, and the collapse is
// that it is the banner ALREADY IN THE TREE: main.js hand-built `.validation-
// banner` twice, for content validation and the surface join, and a third
// hand-built copy is exactly the defect I exist to catch. Both are gone; all
// three call failureBanner().
//
// AND IT IS WORTH MORE THAN A GUARD ON menuTabs() BECAUSE THE FAILURE IS NOW IN
// THE PAGE. tools/release-shots.mjs has ALWAYS scored a `.validation-banner` as
// a MISS. So it sees a throwing screen through an assertion it already had —
// and so does any other instrument that looks at a rendered page, with no
// subscription, no wiring, and nothing per-tool to rot. One report, two
// audiences.

// bundle at 390x844, Text XL, six banners standing: THE TOPBAR SAT AT y=830.06
// IN AN 844 px VIEWPORT. The banner's own body sentence says "the game is still
// running", and there was fourteen pixels of it left to see.
//
// So the stack has a ceiling, and the overflow sentence is NOT a new idea: it
// is the one main.js already uses when the validation list is longer than the
// screen ("…and N more — all N are in the browser console.", #67, Sunna's D19).
// One truncation vocabulary in this game, not two. The door it names is the
// Command log rather than the console, because that is the door a PLAYER has.

// ~452 px tall, which leaves the topbar and the top of the map on screen. A

// Uncaught errors are invisible in most consoles players look at — capture them
// into the log so "it just stopped working" becomes a stack trace, AND raise the
// banner so it becomes something a player and an instrument can both see.
//
// `ev.message` is the filter, deliberately: an <img> that 404s is not a script
// error and must not raise this. Measured — a resource 404 was present in both
// the red and the green run and raised nothing.
//
// AND A NOTIFICATION IS NOT A FAILURE EITHER — the other half of the same
// filter, and the one a player actually met. `ResizeObserver loop completed
// with undelivered notifications` is not an exception: it is the browser
// saying it spent its frame budget delivering resize callbacks and will
// deliver the rest on the next frame. Layout settles, nothing threw, nothing
// was dropped, and the control the player pressed DID work. The spec routes
// it to `window.onerror` anyway, so this listener raised the red block — and
// the banner's own body sentence, "What you last pressed did not", was a
// false statement about a screen that was working.
//
// It arrives with no filename and no line, which is the `at :0` a player sees
// and the reason it cannot be traced to a file even if you wanted to: there
// is no throw site, because there was no throw.
//
// IT STAYS IN THE LOG. A burst of these is a real smell about layout churn
// and an instrument should be able to read it — so it is recorded as NOTICE
// and raises nothing. Anchored, not a substring search: a genuine failure
// that merely NAMES ResizeObserver ("Failed to construct 'ResizeObserver'")
// is a script error and must still raise the banner.
