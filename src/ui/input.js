// src/ui/input.js — unified keyboard + gamepad navigation (SPEC §7.3).
//
// Two layers that make every screen playable without a mouse:
//   1. A focus cursor over interactive elements (buttons, cards, reachable map
//      nodes, tabs, toggles, targetable enemies…). Arrow keys / D-pad / left
//      stick move it spatially; Enter / A activates the focused element.
//   2. A gamepad poller (started only while a pad is connected — no idle loop)
//      that maps buttons to actions. Confirm activates the cursor; Cancel /
//      Menu / End-turn dispatch the same synthetic keys the screens already
//      listen for, so the existing keyboard handlers work with a controller
//      too. Which pad BUTTON drives each action is rebindable (Controls tab).
//
//   3. THE ACTIVATION PRESS (S7, 2026-08-17). Confirm is published as a press
//      with TWO ends — `gppress` / `gprelease` on the focused element — instead
//      of one synthetic click, so a control that has a press-and-hold has it on
//      all three inputs rather than on the mouse alone. Full reasoning at the
//      press-door block below; the gesture side is `armPress` in ui/gesture.js.
//
// The number keys (1–9) and letter hotkeys stay owned by the screens; this
// module adds navigation + controller parity on top without touching them.
//
//   3b. THE PRESS IS NOT ONLY THE CURSOR'S (S7 WIDE, 2026-08-17). Constantine:
//       "if hold is toggled, then it should be the same, in all instances. for
//       ending turn, using flask, event choice, shrine rest." Layer 3 above
//       serves the button that presses the FOCUSED control — and End Turn has
//       no focused control: `.end-turn` matches CHROME below, so the cursor
//       skips it by design and Confirm can never arrive on it. Its keyboard
//       door is `e` and its pad door is button 2, both `kind: 'key'`, and both
//       reached the button as a SYNTHETIC CLICK that walked straight past the
//       hold. So a `kind: 'key'` action whose control has armed a beat now
//       opens the same two-ended press the cursor does — see the action-control
//       registry below.
//
// BOUNDARY, and it is narrower than "every key holds": only a key bound to an
// ACTION ROW here, whose control has ARMED A BEAT, and only while the dial is
// on. The 1–9 / Q quick-play keys are not action rows and are untouched; the
// flask keys `f`/`g`/`h` are rows, but what they press is the flask MENU, which
// commits nothing and owes no beat — the beat is on the menu's Use row, which
// the cursor reaches normally. Both are silence by derivation, not by a list.

//
// WHICH BUTTON, DERIVED RATHER THAN LISTED. The press is the CONFIRM action and
// nothing else: `ACTIONS`' `confirm` row is `kind: 'cursor'`, which is this
// file's own word for "this button acts on the focused control" — i.e. exactly
// the button whose pointer twin is a press ON that control. Its keyboard key is
// read off the row (`key: 'Enter'`) and its pad button off `bindings.confirm`
// AT PRESS TIME, so a rebind carries the hold with it and there is no second
// copy of the mapping to keep in step. The other rows are `kind: 'key'`: they
// dispatch a key the SCREENS interpret, they do not press the thing under the
// cursor, and a hold on them is that screen's question, not this one's.
//
// WHO DECIDES WHETHER A PRESS IS A GESTURE — the control, not this module. The
// two events are CANCELABLE and that is the whole protocol:
//   gppress    preventDefault => "I took this press; hold my activation."
//              Nobody listening, or nobody claiming, and the click fires here
//              and now — byte for byte the pre-door behaviour.
//   gprelease  preventDefault => "the gesture completed; do NOT activate."
//              Otherwise the release IS the tap, which is what an early pointer
//              release has always been.
// This module therefore knows nothing about holds, durations, or which controls
// have one, and it can never drift from the set that does.

 * rather than remembered here:
 *   1. the control is still on the page — a screen change is a disarm this
 *      module never has to be told about;
 *   2. `data-hold-ms` > 0 — reading the value the machinery already published ON
 *      THE CONTROL, so the dial is not re-derived here.
 *
 *      ⚠ AND THIS CLAUSE IS A REDUNDANT GUARD, NOT THE SWITCH — I called it the
 *      switch and I was wrong, and the plant aimed at it is what said so. THE
 *      SWITCH IS `armHold`'s `ms0 > 0`: with the dial off, `begin` declines the
 *      press, `pressBegin` activates immediately, and one key press commits
 *      exactly as before. MEASURED — remove this line and holdconfirm.mjs runs
 *      111 checks and STAYS GREEN, including all four `OFF, one press does…`
 *      cells. Nothing that ships can tell the two apart.
 *
 *      SO WHY IT STAYS. Without it, a dial-off key press reaches the control as
 *      `activateEl`'s dispatched click instead of the SCREEN's own handler, and
 *      those differ on exactly one thing: a `disabled` button. Combat's End Turn
 *      is never disabled (measured — no `.disabled` write in combat.js), but
 *      co-op's is (`et.disabled = !canEnd`), and NO `?shot=` STATE OPENS A
 *      CO-OP BOARD. So the difference is real, unreachable by any instrument
 *      here, and both commits are re-guarded at `onConfirm` anyway.
 *      **`unknown`, not green** — kept because it makes the off position the
 *      old path by construction rather than by an argument about re-guards,
 *      and named here because a line nobody has watched matter is the same
 *      shape as a check nobody has watched fail. It has NO plant, deliberately:
 *      a corpus entry that cannot go red is decoration, and Q4 was deleted
 *      rather than kept green. Whoever finds a door onto co-op should aim one
 *      here first;
 *   3. the control is inside the ACTIVE FOCUS SCOPE. This is the veil rule, and
 *      it is derived from `scopeRoot()` rather than restated: with the draw
 *      pile or any other veil standing, `.end-turn` is not in scope, this
 *      module declines the key, and the event reaches the screen's own handler
 *      which refuses it exactly as it does today. Delete this line and `e`
 *      ends the turn under an open pile — the defect veil-owns-input.mjs
 *      exists for, one input over.

// creation, the LAN lobby, a dialogue, a reward's detail pane, the quest
// board, the farewell screen, the map tray) marks that button `data-back`, and
// this ONE rule presses it — a click on the screen's existing Back, so the key
// and the pad run the same handler the mouse runs, once.
//
// It is the LAST word on Escape, and "last" is enforced, not hoped for:
//   1. `onBackCapture` (window, capture, registered ahead of initInput's own
//      keydown) notes the focus scope, its Back and whether a native popover
//      is open BEFORE the layers on the path answer the press.
//   2. `onBackKey` (window, bubble) only schedules the decision for after the
//      whole dispatch (a task, not a microtask: a real key's microtasks run
//      between listeners). A listener registered after this one — the flask
//      menu's window Cancel, a hold-to-confirm's Escape — has had its say.
//   3. The decision steps aside if the press was taken (`defaultPrevented`),
//      if the scope or the Back it was aimed at is gone or changed (a layer
//      that closed itself without saying so, as the Armoury's document Escape
//      once did; a screen that navigated on its own Escape), or if a
//      light-dismiss native popover was open (character creation's menu): the

//      openPopover). The browser closes a popover on a real Escape; a pad B is a

 *
 * Constantine, 2026-08-17: *"all the buttons on those tool tips should also work
 * and auto map to the current controls configured and the active device
 * controller type."* The hint bar had been an ADVERTISEMENT — `pointer-events:
 * none`, `aria-hidden`, five spans naming five keys — so on a touchscreen it
 * described controls the device does not have and answered to nothing.
 *
 * THIS IS `doAction`, NOT A FOURTH DELIVERY PATH, and that is the whole design.
 * A chip is a THUMB arriving at a binding the keyboard and the pad already reach,
 * so it enters by the door the pad poller enters by and inherits every rule that
 * lives behind it, free and un-restated:
 *   - the CURRENT binding is dispatched, so a rebind moves the chip with the key;
 *   - `pressTarget` gives the chip a HOLD wherever the action owes one — press
 *     and hold the End Turn chip and `.end-turn` itself fills under the words,
 *     short-press and it aborts, exactly as `e` does (S7, six hours old);
 *   - `scopeRoot()` means a chip is refused while a veil stands, for the same
 *     reason the key is;
 *   - the dial at `off` collapses both to one press.
 * A second implementation here would be a second chance to disagree with all of
 * that, which is the defect this house is named for.
 *
 * ⚠ IT DOES NOT SET `engaged`, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE RATHER THAN AN OMISSION.
 * `engaged` means "this player drives with a keyboard or a pad", and screens use
 * it to decide whether to plant a focus ring nobody asked for. A thumb on a chip
 * is the opposite of that evidence. A mouse-only player pressing a chip must not
 * inherit a focus cursor.
 *
 * `cancelled` exists for a pointer the browser takes away mid-press (a scroll, a
 * drag out of the chip): the same verdict a cancelled hold gets everywhere else
 * — nothing commits.
