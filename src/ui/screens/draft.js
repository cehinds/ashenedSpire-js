// picks one each round to add to their starting deck. Deterministic on the
// run's rng (stream 'cardRewards'), so a seed drafts the same offers.
//
// ON THE KIT: a page with the screen's banner (Eyebrow + Title·L), the round
// as a Subtitle, the offer as the kit's Cards in a row, and the tally as a
// StatPair.
