    //
    // The lockout property is "a player who cannot perform a hold can still
    // leave every event screen", and that has to hold at EVERY purse. My
    // instrument was reading `disabled`, which is a fact about ONE MOUNTED
    // STATE: `meets()` below disables only an UNAFFORDABLE requirement, and
    // `balance.startingCinders` is 0, so the sweep mounts poor and the two
    // predicates happen to agree. They agreed via a number in balance.js that
    // nothing tied to them. Raise the purse and they diverge on three choices
    // (weepingPilgrim, sleepingSmith, merchantsGhost) — no verdict moved, which
    // is luck, not a guarantee.
    //
    // So the fact goes on the element, like `data-binding` beside it: a door
    // behind a price is not a door you can count on, at any purse, and the
    // instrument reads that off the screen instead of re-deriving it.
    // ---- BOTH CONTENT FACTS ARE WRITTEN HERE, ABOVE THE BRANCH, and the second
    // one is Vira handing me my own sentence back a second time: LATENT IS NOT
    // FIXED. I hoisted `data-requires` out of the affordability branch and
    // walked straight past its neighbour three lines below, in the same
    // function. `data-binding` was set only inside the AFFORDABLE branch, so an
    // unaffordable binding choice published NO `data-binding` — the screen
    // saying "not binding" about a choice that is.
    //
    // It changes nothing today: she checked rather than assumed, and the
    // priced-and-binding overlap is EMPTY across all 54 shipped choices; the
    // free-door test was safe regardless, because such a bar carries
    // `data-requires`. It is still the same defect, and the reason it is worth
    // the hoist is her breadcrumb, which I am keeping verbatim:
    //
    //   WHEN A FACT MOVES FROM A MODULE ONTO A SCREEN, ASK AT WHAT MOMENT IT IS
    //   WRITTEN. A `data-` attribute set inside a conditional branch is a STATE
    //   FACT WEARING A CONTENT FACT'S CLOTHES.
    //
    // So: whether this choice is priced, and whether it binds, are properties of
    // the ENTRY and are published unconditionally. What stays inside the branch
    // is only what is genuinely about this moment — the disabling, and the
    // arming of a gesture on a button nobody can press.
