// src/ui/screens/compendium.js — the Compendium: everything the Spire keeps.
//
// Constantine, verbatim: *"the potential weapons to unlock should be in its own
// menu on the main menu that keeps most things hidden."*
//
// THE LAST CLAUSE IS THE DESIGN, not decoration. This is a screen whose subject
// is the shape of what you do NOT have, and the honest failure modes sit either
// side of it: show everything and the surprise of finding a Twinblade is spent
// in a menu on turn one; show nothing and it is an empty room with a title. So
// the line, and it is one sentence:
//
//     A LOCKED ENTRY GIVES YOU ITS SHAPE AND ITS RARITY AND NOTHING ELSE.
//
// Shape is enough to want it. A name and a stat line is the item delivered
// without the climb. The silhouette is the piece's OWN icon painted to black —
// no second asset, no new column, nothing for an author to draw twice (Law 1
// clause 4: assets bind by name, and this binds to the same name).
//
// ---- AND THE ASSET SET CANNOT HONOUR THAT PROMISE FIVE TIMES ----------------
//
// Freja's own finding against her own screen, measured AT THE 68 px BOX THE GAME
// ACTUALLY PAINTS rather than at native size — which is the half that matters,
// and the half a native-size measurement had already missed. Carried into the
// merge by Viki because a promise this file cannot keep is a claim, not a bug
// report, and the claim is the thing I own:
//
//   24 icons -> 21 DISTINCT silhouettes at 68 px. Two collision groups.
//   buckler == roundShield == spikedShield   one drawing. A REDRAW.
//   ashStaff  vs boneSceptre                 15 differing px at 224, ZERO at
//                                            68. The BOX destroys a real
//                                            distinction — a different fix, and
//                                            nobody had named this one.
//
// SHARPEST, AND IT IS NOT A DEGRADED PROMISE BUT AN ABSENT ONE: `buckler` and
// `roundShield` share shape AND rarity. Two cells with NO distinguishing mark
// between them at all, stacked in the same column at 390. For that pair the
// sentence above delivers nothing.
//
// NEITHER FIX IS IN THIS FILE and neither is taken here: one is a redraw, one is
// a box size, and both are art direction. What is fixed here is the OVER-CLAIM —
// this header stated a property of the asset set that five cells do not have.
//
// ---- WHY IT IS NOT ORGANISED BY WHAT YOU HAVE -------------------------------
//
// The obvious build is two bands: YOURS, then the rest. I refused it. Two bands
// makes the screen's shape a function of your progress — on a fresh profile band
// one is empty and the whole page is a list of things you failed to get, and
// every find reflows the grid under you.
//
// So the structure is the COLLECTION's shape and it never moves: one section per
// armament kind, in the order the table declares them, every cell always in the
// same place. What changes is how much of it is LIT. In a palette this dark,
// LIGHT IS THE HIERARCHY — the eye lands on what is yours because it is the only
// bright thing in the grid, and I do not have to reorder anything to put it
// first. A constant grid that fills in reads as a map of what exists; a
// re-sorting list reads as a scoreboard.
//
// ON THE KIT, AS WIREFRAME W1f: a W1 workspace standing on the page. The head
// is the title "Compendium" (the whole count as its eyebrow) with the close in
// the corner; the body is a NavRail — one RailItem per kind, its held count as
// StatusText — beside a Pane split into the entry list (a grid of OptionCards)
// and the selected entry's known facts; the foot is the one Back action. On a
// compact host the rail becomes one `[Kind ▾]` selector above the pane and the
// two slots stack (components/w1Workspace.js). Each card is the kit's
// OptionCard with an ArtWell for its Glyph; a withheld piece is the `is-ghost`
// variant (dashed, the icon painted out, no name) and carries its rarity on
// the card's edge. The detail slot says exactly what the tooltip says, from
// models/CompendiumModel.js. The hooks tools read (`.compendium[data-surface]`,
// `.cp-cell`, `.cp-grid`, `.cp-scroll`, `#cp-back`) ride on kit parts and draw
// nothing.
//
// ---- WHAT AN AUTHOR WRITES, AND WHAT DERIVES (Law 0 clause 1) ---------------
//
// NOTHING. There is no compendium table and there must never be one. A row here
// IS a row of content/source/weapons.csv seen from another angle, and everything
// this screen draws comes off the characteristics already on it:
//
//   which section    `kind`            the section exists because a row is filed
//                                      under it — no authored list of sections
//   the silhouette   `id`              assets/equipment/icon_<id>.webp, the same
//                                      file the Armoury already binds by name
//   the rarity ring  `rarity`
//   is it yours      `unlock` + the found gate → ownership() in model/loadout.js
//   how much shows   that gate's reveal mode  → pieceReveal() in model/unlocks.js
//
// Two homes, and the split is the point (Viki, resolving the #90 merge): the
// first is a fact about your PROFILE, the second about the CATALOGUE ROW. This
// screen authors neither and asks both.
//
// A second list of unlockables would be the defect this house has spent two days
// killing, and it is the easiest one to commit here: this screen wants a table
// of "things to chase" so badly that writing one feels like the feature.
//
// ---- WHAT THIS SCREEN IS NOT ------------------------------------------------
//
// It is not the Armoury and it does not equip anything: it is reached from the
// title, where there is no run, no class, and therefore no armour — armour is
// `classId`-scoped and has no subject outside a run. THAT IS WHY THE SCREEN IS
// ARMAMENTS ONLY, and the reason is where he put it, not my taste.
//
// ~~Armour's unlocks are already visible, with their hints, in the Armoury
// picker.~~ STRUCK BY THE MERGE, not by its author (Viki). That was true at
// 77a02b9 and #90 falsified it underneath this branch: the picker now offers
// only what you own, so an unearned armour set is ABSENT there rather than
// locked-with-a-hint. Nine of twelve armour rows carry an unlock, and as of dev
// no screen in the game says they exist — `unlockView()` below, whose whole job
// is "what the wardrobe should draw", has ZERO callers in src/ at every ref I
// checked (77a02b9, e79e1cd, 52e0bc1).
//
// THE HOLE IS #90'S, NOT THIS SCREEN'S, and this branch neither opens nor closes
// it. Recorded here because the sentence it replaces gave a REASON for excluding
// armour, and that reason has expired: whether armour joins this screen is a
// design call for Freja and Constantine ("weapons" was his word), not a
// resolution I take while merging someone else's branch. The rail is where a
// further category (armour, cards, relics, flasks) would join: one RailItem,
// one pane of the same OptionCards.
//
// LAW 3: the rail switches SECTION (kit §03 RailItem), not tabs — the bumpers
// stay with whatever owns them. Every cell is a control and carries a tooltip
// for hover AND the focus cursor (clause 4), which is also where a locked
// cell's reason lives: printing "not yet found" twenty three times IS the wall
// of grey, and the wall is the thing to avoid.
//
// TWO OPEN, NEITHER THIS BRANCH'S AND NEITHER FIXED HERE (Freja, carried by Viki
// so the next reader does not rediscover them):
//
//   THE TAP PATH IS WRONG, on the screen whose whole payload is the tooltip. It
//   shows under the finger with `afterRelease: null`, and the 24 <button>s below
//   carry NO click handler at all. That is component behaviour and it is already
//   on dev — `showTooltipAt()` exists, one handler closes it, and it is hers.
//
//   GOLD MEANS TWO THINGS ON ONE GRID — *rare* and *yours*. Her palette, and
//   Sunna's floor the moment it costs the read.
