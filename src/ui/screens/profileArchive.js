// src/ui/screens/profileArchive.js — title-screen Profile archive (#67, Sunna's D8/D5).
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The crisis dialog told the player "You can come back to
// it any time from the title screen's Profile route and Settings had Display, Audio,
// Accessibility, Advanced — no Profile. The word "archive" appeared on no
// screen in the game, and profileNotice.js was the only file that had ever
// called listArchives/getArchive/exportArchive/restoreProfile. Constantine's
// answer to that was one word — "build" — so the surface exists and the
// sentence becomes true rather than being cut.
//
// It also closes Sunna's D5: the handle used to live only inside a dialog that
// fires once per session, so past that screen by any route a player could never
// reach their archived profile again. The drawer's handle was fitted to a door
// that locks behind you. This is the calm-moment route — the person who needs
// it on Tuesday is the whole point.
//
// HER MUSTS BIND HERE, and they shaped the decisions:
//   · The comfort is the FACT of preservation, not its contents — so every
//     entry shows what it is, when it was set aside and how big, even when the
//     bytes themselves cannot be read (which is the normal case).
//   · Nothing irreversible is forced, and "start a new profile" is NOT on this
//     screen at all: on a calm day there is no reason to offer it, and its only
//     honest home is the crisis dialog behind its confirm.
//   · A failed restore never consumes the archive, and says so.
//
// ON THE KIT, AS WIREFRAME W1g: a W1 workspace door through openModal (Eyebrow
// "Player data", Title·S "Profile", the close IconButton in the corner, one
// Back action in the foot). The body is a NavRail beside a Pane. The rail's
// categories are the two kinds of entry the drawer holds — set-aside profiles
// and set-aside runs (models/ProfileWorkspaceModel.js) — and on a compact host
// it becomes one `[Kind ▾]` selector above the pane (components/w1Workspace.js).
// The Pane is split into the current profile's identity (the state line, the
// drawer policy, a muted DetailCard for a drawer notice) and the selected
// category's records: one DetailCard per entry (Eyebrow = when, name = what,
// line = why) with its ButtonRow and support Fold, a gold DetailCard for the
// restore question, and the status line. The hooks the instruments read
// (`.profile-archive-modal`, `.profile-archive-body`, `[data-profile-close]`,
// `.prof-*`) ride on the kit's parts and draw nothing.
//
// PROSE IS DRAFT where Sunna has not written copy for this surface, and marked
// so below; her replacements land verbatim as they did on the notice screen.
