// ---- the view set: a row DESCRIBES a layout, and the CELL is the vocabulary --
//
// EldenSpire#78, second pass. The first pass killed `if (view === 'grid') … else
// …` — the id was the handler, so a fourth id fell into the else and rendered as
// hybrid in silence. It replaced the id with two characteristics and declared
// each of them closed ON ITS OWN:
//
//     VIEW_VOCAB = { figure: [true, false], slots: ['flank', 'list'] }
//
// THAT IS NOT A CLOSED SET. It is two closed sets whose PRODUCT is four cells,
// and the screen drew three. Vira's gate found the fourth: one row of data,
// `{ id:'ghost', figure:false, slots:'flank' }`, written entirely in words this
// file declared legal — it passed viewLayout, took the flank branch (which
// appended the figure without ever consulting `figure`), and was then blanked by
// a ui.css rule whose real predicate was `figure:false AND slots:'list'`. Two
// mistakes that cancelled into `bodyInk: 0`: an empty armoury, no error, no
// banner, every instrument green. WORSE than the `else` it replaced, which at
// least rendered hybrid. Marina's property, house-wide from today:
//
//     A CLOSED SET MUST STAY CLOSED UNDER WHATEVER FACTORISATION REPLACES IT.
//
// So the unit of the vocabulary here is the CELL, not the factor. `LAYOUTS`
// below is keyed by the whole combination, and ITS KEYS ARE THE CLOSED SET — a
// row whose combination is not a key fails by name at boot (surfaces.js) and in
// the panel, exactly as an unknown word does. There is no second list of legal
// cells anywhere to disagree with this one: THE TABLE THAT DRAWS A CELL IS THE
// TABLE THAT DECLARES IT, and what an author may write is DERIVED from it
// (`viewCells()`), never written beside it. A second declaration is precisely
// how the fourth cell got in.
//
// This also answers the seam Vira left open — *"I proved the fourth cell renders
// nothing; I did not prove there are only four cells that matter."* There is
// nothing to enumerate: `slots: 'ring'` tomorrow makes the product six, and all
// six of those cells are legal only if six keys exist. Adding a value to a
// factor grants nothing on its own. That is the honest edge and it is now

// ---- the regions: which pane is the SUBJECT, and which is CONTEXT -----------
//
// EldenSpire#90. Constantine asked for the card list to be collapsible "so that
// I can see the armory slots better", and the clause after "so that" is the
// missing word, not the feature. `collapsible: true` on a pane states a
// MECHANISM; what the screen did not carry is which pane you opened it FOR. You
// collapse the context; you never collapse the subject.
//
// THIS SCREEN HAD ALREADY DECIDED IT, THREE TIMES, IN THREE MECHANISMS — which
// is why this is a collapse and not a feature:
//
//   narrowDefaultView: 'rack'   a phone opens on the view with no figure
//   `[data-slots='flank']:not(.picking) .armoury-right { display: none }`
//                               a whole pane hidden at narrow, no control, no
//                               trace, nothing a player can put back
//   Freja's armoury ruling      "a picture before the controls is a wall"
//
// One fact — the slots are the subject — written three times with nothing
// checking they agree. That is the second copy this seat exists to refuse.
//
// THE FIGURE IS DELIBERATELY NOT A REGION. `rack` already IS the figure's
// collapse: a whole declared view whose only job is to remove it. Making the
// figure collapsible too would be two mechanisms for one act, which is the
// defect, not the feature.
//
// FLAT, AND SAID OUT LOUD SO NOBODY DISCOVERS IT. The regions are the armoury's
// own children. Ordering INSIDE a region (Freja's figure-below-gear at narrow)
// is one level down and does NOT fall out of this word — a region TREE is a

 *
 * THE SHAPE'S DEFAULT FOR CONTEXT IS *COLLAPSED*, ON EVERY SHAPE — Constantine's
 * ruling, 2026-08-21: *the Armoury opens with the figure, and CARDS is one click
 * away.* It used to be `!!narrow` — collapsed on a phone only — and the cost of
 * that was measured, not argued, at dev `456b8ea`, 1440x860, `?shot=combat`:
 *
 *     arrival, CARDS expanded   .armoury-figure VISIBLE 260x139  (area 36140)
 *     after one CARDS click     .armoury-figure VISIBLE 260x330  (area 85800)
 *
 * THE LAYOUT BOX IS 260x330 BOTH TIMES AND THAT IS THE TRAP. `getBoundingClientRect`
 * on the figure never moves; what moves is `.armoury-left`, its scroll parent,
 * which is 275x139 with the strip open and 260x628 with it shut. Reading the
 * figure's own rect says "nothing changed" while 58% of the figure is behind a
 * clipped, scrolling edge. The number this rule is answerable to is therefore the
 * VISIBLE area — the rect intersected with every clipping ancestor — and it is
 * measured that way in tools/armoury-arrival-figure.mjs, both edges, both shapes.
 *
 * NARROW IS NOT CONSULTED ANY MORE, AND DROPPING IT IS THE POINT, NOT AN OVERSIGHT.
 * `narrow` here was a SECOND decider of what arrives open, on top of
 * `narrowDefaultView` — which already answers "what does a phone open on" and
 * answers it with `rack`, the view whose whole job is to have no figure. Measured
 * at 390x844: `.armoury-figure` is ABSENT, so on a phone there was never a figure
 * for the strip to squeeze, and this rule changes NOTHING there — the phone
 * already opened folded. Keeping the parameter would have left two rules that can
 * disagree about one screen, which is #24's shape.
 *
 * The parameter is gone from the signature rather than left unread: an argument
 * nothing consults is the next reader's false lead, and mountEquipment is its one
 * caller.
