  // HIS REPORT, LOOKING AT THE ADVANCED SECTION LIST: "no good section to
  // customize combat, combat animation, etc". He was right, and the reason is
  // that combat's presentation had no home — it had three.
  //
  //   Combat pacing / Rendering quality / Screen shake / played-card animation
  //     -> General > Display > "Effects & pacing", a bag that also held the
  //        TITLE SCREEN's lit-city pause, so its name did not promise combat.
  //   Character sprites -> Advanced > Interface > "Characters", i.e. behind the
  //        debugging surface, for a row that decides what a player looks at for
  //        the whole run.
  //   Combat Armaments / phone placement -> General > Display > "Interface",
  //        filed with the accent colour and the UI scale.
  //
  // And the one section NAMED for combat — Advanced > "Combat & actors" — is
  // authored balance constants (poise, exposure), which is the opposite of what
  // the name offers someone hunting for an animation switch.
  //
  // So these seven rows carry `cat: 'Combat'` and the General tab grows a third
  // group beside Display and Audio (GENERAL_GROUPS). NOT a fourth top-level tab:
  // `filedCategories()` is authored, so a new `cat` adds a GROUP and never a tab
  // — the tab strip stays three wide at every screen size it was measured at.
  //
  // NOTHING IS DUPLICATED. A row has one home; each of these moved, and the
  // Advanced tip now says where the feel settings went so the section named for
  // combat stops being a dead end.

// up `ROWS.filter(r => r.cat === cat)`. A name in that list with no rows and no
// section rendered a LONE HEADING — the author did the data-driven thing and got
// a promise with nothing behind it, in silence.
//
// So the list is no longer authored. A category EXISTS because something is
// filed under it: a `cat:` on a row, or a section below. What stays authored is
// the ORDER, which is a design decision and not derivable — and a name in the
// order that nothing files under is a defect that fails by name at boot
// (assertSurfaces, src/ui/surfaces.js), not a heading over nothing.
//
// Adding a settings row under a brand-new category needs NO edit here: the
// heading appears, after the ordered ones, in the order its first row appears.
//
// SECTIONS are categories whose contents are code rather than rows.
// Profile is a title-screen route; Settings no longer duplicates that drawer.
// About carries the AI-use acknowledgement, rendered from its one home in
// src/content/aiDisclosure.js — the same text the store page shows (#69).
//
// `tip` IS THE ONE THING A SECTION HAS TO WRITE, and it is the honest edge of
// clause 7 on this screen. A category made of rows derives its tooltip from the
// rows filed under it — the author writes nothing. A section has no rows to
// read, so its one sentence is authored here, where its code already is. That

/**
 * renderSettings(container, { settings, onChange, grouped })
 * Fills `container` with the settings controls and wires change events.
 * grouped=true draws the category TAB STRIP and one category at a time.
 *
 * SIX SECTIONS USED TO BE SIX HEADINGS DOWN ONE SCROLLING COLUMN. One name was
 * on screen when Settings opened, at every shape and every text size measured;
 * AUDIO sat 1848px below DISPLAY at 390/Text M, and the last section was five
 * thumb-drags away — eight at Text XL, and six at 1200x730, so it was never
 * only a phone. A gold, letter-spaced, uppercase heading promises a taxonomy;
 * hiding five sixths of it is the promise broken in silence.
 *
 * BOTH EDGES, because a tab strip can break this in the other direction:
 *   - six sections must not become six screens a player has to HUNT — so the
 *     whole strip is on screen at once and wraps rather than scrolling
 *     sideways. All six names are readable before the first tap.
 *   - a section that scrolls internally must STILL SCROLL — the panel keeps
 *     the container's overflow, so Display's sixteen rows are all reachable.
 *
 * NOTHING NEW IS AUTHORED to add a seventh. `settingsCategories()` already
 * derives the set from what is filed; a tab, its tooltip, its bumper stop and
 * its place in the ring all follow from that one list.

      // the race rather than inferred from it.

      // write that is merely SLOW — a browser holding it while it asks for

      // failed. Two consequences, and only the second can be prevented:
      //
      //   * The clipboard ends up holding this block after the UI said it did
      //     not. Nothing in the platform can undo that, so it is SAID rather

      //   * Two exports could otherwise be in flight at once and land in
      //     either order, so the newer text loses to the older. That one is
      //     preventable: while a write is outstanding the button refuses to
      //     start another, and says why.
      // REFUSING THE WRITE IS NOT REFUSING THE EXPORT, and the first version of
      // this guard confused the two. `writeText` that NEVER settles — the very
      // case the timeout exists for — leaves the flag raised for the rest of

      // meant the second click did nothing at all: no console block, no button
      // change, and a slider moved afterwards could not be exported by ANY
