// src/ui/screens/rest.js — a location's Rest screen: Rest, and the services
// the place carries (SPEC §7.1, §13.4j; what a Rest restores is the location's
// tag set, engine/locations.js — this screen states no number of its own)
//
// TWO ACTIONS ON THIS SCREEN TAKE A SECOND BEAT, and they take DIFFERENT ONES,
// which is the clearest illustration in the tree of why the form is derived
// rather than chosen:
//
//   REST holds. Rest and Smith are two adjacent panels and taking either closes
//   the other, so the mistake is a THUMB LANDING 14 px OFF — and the answer is
//   the fill, inside the same gesture.
//   SMITH CONFIRMS. Constantine asked for the upgrade preview to be
//   confirmable. #105 shipped a per-card HOVER tooltip, which on a phone was
//   nothing at all, and then one tap committed. Smithing now selects the source
//   armament and shows every affected basic-card delta in a persistent panel;
//   what the player needs is to SEE THE WHOLE PROMOTION and then say yes.
//
// Neither of those decisions is in this file. `model/secondbeat.js` holds the
// characteristics; this screen names its actions.

             cinders)". Cinders buy no level now (plan phase 6): the card is
