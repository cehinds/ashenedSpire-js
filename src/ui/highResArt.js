// src/ui/highResArt.js — Settings → Display → Art quality: lay a local high-res
// art source over the built-in art (LFS / art-tier plan, step 4, 2026-09-26).
//
// The built-in art is whatever this build carries: the light tier on dev/test,
// the full art on release/main. "Local high-res" swaps in full-resolution files
// the player has, from one of two places:
//
//   · a folder served next to the game — `hd/art-manifest.json` beside
//     AshenSpire.html, listing the files under `hd/` (the unpacked high-res
//     release). Found automatically over http(s); file:// cannot fetch it.
//   · a folder the player picks — any build, file:// included. The browser
//     hands over its files for this page's lifetime only, so a reload asks
//     again; the choice of tier itself is remembered.
//
// Either way the result is a Map from asset id (the runtime `assets/…` path) to
// a loadable URL, holding only the files that exist. src/ui/assetmap.js consults
// it first and falls back to the built-in art for every id it lacks, so a
// partial folder is never a broken screen. The setting is per-device and never
// synced (LOCAL_ONLY_KEYS in src/model/settingsSync.js): a folder on this machine means
// nothing on another.
