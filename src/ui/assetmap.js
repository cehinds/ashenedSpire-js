//
// Every rendered image is referenced by a path built at runtime
// (`assets/equipment/weapon_${id}.webp`), so no bundler can find them by
// reading the source. This map is the answer: tools/bundle.mjs REPLACES the
// empty object below with { path: 'data:image/webp;base64,...' } for every file
// under assets/, and assetUrl() prefers it.
//
// Served from a directory the map stays empty and the browser fetches files
// normally — which is what you want in development, since a 1 MB inlined blob
// would have to be re-read on every reload.
//
// This file is the ONLY place that knows the difference between the two, and
// the bundler's replacement is anchored on the exact line below.

// is the runtime path above; art-manifest.json lists, per id, the file
// each tier ships. The built-in art is whatever this build carries — the light
// tier on dev/test, the full art on release/main — and a high-res source may be
// laid over it (the Art quality setting, step 4, sets one). That source is a
// Map from id to a URL the browser can load: object URLs for a folder the
// player picked, or `hd/…` paths for a folder served next to the game. It holds
// only the files that exist, so an id it lacks falls back to the built-in art.

// one: the loader does nothing there.
