// Same shape both times (measure anchor, measure self, offset, clamp), different
// answers, and neither could be fixed without editing the other.
//
// THE INTENT IS NAMED BY THE CALLER, NEVER GUESSED HERE. "Beside it" and "under
// it" are DIFFERENT ANSWERS to different questions, and a function that picks

// nobody photographed. A tooltip must not cover what it explains, so it takes any
// side that fits; a dropdown hangs off its button, so it takes one.
//
// THE GAP HAS ONE HOME AND IT IS THE STYLESHEET (Law 0 clause 4). A distance
// between two boxes is a length, lengths live in CSS, and the number a harness
// measures must be the number the code used. `--place-gap` on the PLACED element
// is that one home: `#tooltip { --place-gap: 14px }` replaces `const pad = 14`,
// and an instrument reads the same declaration through getComputedStyle that this
// function does. It is deliberately an unregistered custom property, so it
// computes to its own token and does NOT track --ui-zoom or the text-size dial —
// which is exactly what the two literals it replaces did (Law 2 rule 3: px where
// a value must not answer to text size, and a hairline gap is not read text).

 *                      through right / below / above only when it cannot fit.
 *           'right'  — toward the centre from a left-edge anchor, with the
 *                      mirrored fallback order.
 *           'above'  — above it when possible, otherwise under it. This is the

 *                      of the component being held or resized.
 *           'under'  — under it, and only under it. When it does not fit, the
 *                      bound answers; that is the caller's declared preference,
 *                      not a failure to consider the alternatives.

 *                      to stay on screen, which is what made three of its
 *                      candidates usable at all.
 *   clear   an element or box to KEEP OFF IF IT CAN — the anchor's own group,
 *           named at the call site. Of the candidates that fit, the one that
 *           overlaps this least wins; ties fall to the declared order, so a
 *           caller that passes nothing gets exactly `first that fits`. It is a
 *           PREFERENCE and never a veto: when no candidate can clear the group,
 *           the answer is the one the caller would have got without it.
 *   layer   the containing block, VIEWPORT_ORIGIN by default (a `fixed` element).
 *   view    that container's box, in its own local space.
