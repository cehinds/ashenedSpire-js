// src/model/mapview.js — the act map's VIEW GEOMETRY, and the one place that
// turns it into an answer about whether a knob is satisfiable.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Constantine asked the map to open "zoomed in close
// enough that the current node and its connecting nodes fit." That is not a
// preference, it is arithmetic: how wide is the thing we must show, how wide is
// the space we have, what zoom relates them. Until now the two halves of that
// arithmetic lived in different worlds — the column pitch and the zoom ladder in
// `ui/components/mapboard.js`, the `columns` knob in `content/mapconfig.js`, and nothing
// anywhere that could answer "does this act's width fit on a phone?".
//
// So the numbers move here, once, and get three readers (Law 0 clause 4, one
// home per fact):
//
//   ui/components/mapboard.js draws with them, and computes the opening zoom from them
//   model/validate.js   REFUSES a `columns` value that makes the ask impossible
//   tools/mapfit.mjs    measures the shipped screen against them
//
// THE MEASUREMENT THAT DECIDES ALL OF IT, and it is re-runnable rather than
// remembered:
//
//   node tools/mapplan.mjs --spans --seeds 300
//
// prints, per `columns`, the widest framing the generator can ask the camera to
// draw. At 300 seeds x 8 column counts, the widest fan-out from a single node is
// exactly `floor(columns / 2) + 1` columns at every width measured — which is
// `maxFanoutSpan` below. It is an OBSERVED maximum, so it is a floor under the
// true worst case and never a ceiling: a `columns` value this file accepts can
// still produce a wider frame on an unlucky seat. That is why the refusal below
// is not the only guard — the running screen reports a frame it could not fit
// (`.map-scroll[data-framing="clipped"]`), so the optimistic half is watched by
// the pessimistic half.

/* ----------------------------------------------------------------- MARGINS --
 *
 * A DERIVED REFUSAL THAT PRINTS A VERDICT AND NOT A MARGIN CANNOT BE WATCHED.
 * Marina's collapse, 2026-08-08, of two findings that arrived hours apart from
 * two seats neither of whom had seen the other:
 *
 *   VIRA, horizontal. `columns: 9` is accepted, and it now wants 1.02x where it
 *   wanted 1.05x — the last accepted width sits 2% off the cliff and nothing was
 *   watching that number. The refusal said `accepted`. It never said `by 2%`.
 *
 *   SUNNA, vertical. The node that grew to meet the tap floor ate the space
 *   BETWEEN nodes in the same stroke: at 08e184a she measured 44.09 px of node
 *   against a 47.0 px row pitch at 390x844, and 36.25 against 39.0 at 320x640 —
 *   under 3 px of air between two adjacent, irreversible taps. Correctly and
 *   silently. Constantine's next rendered read was simpler: too close.
 *   SUNNA, vertical. The circles that grew to meet the tap floor ate the space
 *   BETWEEN circles in the same stroke, correctly and silently. Nothing read a
 *   gap on this screen — which is a sentence she had already written about the
 *   event screen's choice bars, in `content/balance.js`, weeks before tonight.
 *
 * A VERDICT HAS NO DERIVATIVE; A MARGIN DOES. Both axes compute one below, both
 * refusals print it, and each margin has a floor that can go red. The floors sit
 * BELOW today's values on purpose: today is legal, and the whole point is that
 * the next change to NODE_R, ROW_H, COL_X, BOSS_RATIO or
 * `balance.ui.tapSize.def` cannot quietly eat what is left.
 *
 * AND THE VERTICAL HALF CAME BACK CORRECTED, TWICE, BOTH FROM SUNNA AND BOTH
 * AGAINST ME — the record matters more than the tidy version:
 *
 *   1. THE PREMISE WAS WRONG. I wrote the floor to protect "two adjacent,
 *      irreversible taps". Adjacent-floor nodes are never both live: only
 *      reachable nodes get a handler and every edge runs floor -> floor+1, so a
 *      reachable set is one floor. 987 live pairs over 2,601 decision moments,
 *      all of them on one floor; the closest two LIVE doors are 54.23 px at 390.
 *      She drove real touch events too — slide off, lift over a neighbour, tap
 *      between: nothing fires, and the abort has shipped since the first commit.
 *      Her verdict on a mercy hold: NO, and the reason is hers to keep — it would
 *      charge the most-repeated tap in the game 600 ms against a survivable miss.
 *   2. THE SHAPE WAS WRONG, AND THAT ONE IS THE FINDING. My first margin computed
 *      `ROW_H - 2 * NODE_R`: two IDENTICAL circles. The boss carries a different
 *      radius, so the one pair on this screen that is ACTUALLY COLLIDING is the
 *      pair my invariant could not express. `pairAir` ranges over the pairs that
 *      exist now — see it, and the boss/shrine overlap it finds, below.
 *
 * Scaling every geometric term together is a no-op under Fit: multiply COL_X,
 * ROW_H and NODE_R by k and Fit divides zoom by k. The floor pitch is therefore
 * derived from DEVICE space while COL_X and NODE_R keep their own jobs.
 * `tools/mapspacing.mjs` reads the rendered result at both phone shapes and both
 * zoom modes; source constants are not allowed to grade themselves.
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT — and it is the first thing to say, because the obvious next
 * move is the wrong one. This is NOT an attempt to reach 44 device px on the map.
 * Two node centres are 34 px apart at 320x640, so that target cannot exist there
 * at any radius; and SCALING THE GEOMETRY IS A NO-OP — multiply COL_X, ROW_H and
 * NODE_R by k and the fit zoom divides by k, delivering the same device px. The
 * margins are made WATCHABLE here, not big. Whether an overlap READS as broken is
 * Freja's call and whether the surface needs mercy is Sunna's; this file is the
 * number under both, never the answer to either.
 *
 * DIVISION OF LABOUR BETWEEN THE TWO FLOORS, since neither watches everything:
 * the collision floor is what binds NODE_R, ROW_H and BOSS_RATIO tightly; the
 * fan-out floor is what binds COL_X tightly. Each watches the constants that
 * live on it, and both print the next value that would take them red.

/**
 * FLOOR 1, HORIZONTAL — how many columns WIDER than the measured maximum fan-out

 *
 * ONE, and the reason is this file's own confession. `maxFanoutSpan` is an

 * never a ceiling". The slack is the premium on that admission, and one column
 * is the size of the failure being admitted to: `mapplan --spans` sweeps a
 * three-knob grid and the formula has never been exceeded, so what is insured
 * against is off-by-one, not off-by-two.
 *
 * IT IS A JUDGEMENT, IT COSTS SOMETHING, AND THE COST IS STATED RATHER THAN
 * BURIED: at the constants as they stand tonight, `columns` 8 and 9 were accepted
 * before this commit and are refused after it. Both sat at 1.02x with zero spare
 * columns. Nothing ships at either — acts 1, 2 and 3 all ship 7 — and 7 clears

/**
 * FLOOR 2 — the air between two node circles that are drawn NEXT TO EACH OTHER,
 * in DEVICE px, at the smallest shape this game claims (320x640).
 *
 * THE REASON I FIRST GAVE FOR THIS FLOOR WAS WRONG, AND SUNNA FALSIFIED IT WITH
 * RENDERED EVIDENCE RATHER THAN ARGUMENT. I wrote "a dead zone between two
 * adjacent, irreversible taps". There is no such pair on the vertical axis:
 * only reachable nodes get a click handler (`ui/components/mapboard.js`) and every edge
 * runs floor -> floor+1, so A REACHABLE SET IS ALWAYS ONE FLOOR. She measured 72
 * graphs, 2,601 decision moments, 987 live pairs — all 987 on one floor, and the
 * closest two LIVE doors are 54.23 px at 390 and 44.59 at 320. She then drove it
 * with real touch events: slide off, lift over a neighbour, tap the air between —
 * nothing fires. Her verdict on a hold: no, and she is right.
 *
 * SO THE FLOOR SURVIVES WITH A DIFFERENT JOB: LEGIBILITY, NOT MERCY. Two circles
 * that touch or overlap read as one shape, and the overlap the census below finds
 * is real and rendered. That is Freja's and Sunna's ground to judge; keeping the
 * circles visibly separate is the engineering floor under it.
 *
 * TWO, and the whole reason, because a threshold is a judgement and should read
 * as one:
 *
 *   · It is BELOW every rendered air on this map today except the one that is
 *     already negative, so it was not fitted to a reading I liked.
 *   · It is not ONE: the chain SVG unit -> local px -> device px rounds at the
 *     edge of one circle and the edge of the next, and a 1 px claim of air cannot
 *     survive two roundings. Two is the smallest air still air afterwards.
 *   · It is a floor on AIR, never on target size. The target size question was
 *     answered by `nodeRadiusFor` and is not re-asked here.
 *
 * THE DERIVATION IS THE OPTIMISTIC HALF AND SAYS SO. At 08e184a it predicted
 * 3.52 device px at 390 while the screen delivered 2.9. A floor cleared here is
 * not a floor cleared on glass; `tools/mapspacing.mjs` now owns that reading.
 * AND MY STATED BOUNDARY WAS WRONG IN THE OTHER DIRECTION TOO — struck rather
 * than edited away. I wrote that "derivation is the optimistic half" because her
 * relayed 2.9 sat below my derived 3.52. Her 2.9 was a rounding of a pitch read
 * as 47.0; the pitch is 47.61 and the rendered air is 3.52 at 390 and 2.89 at
 * 320. THIS ARITHMETIC MATCHED THE PAINT TO THE HUNDREDTH, on all three pairs
 * below. I had written a caveat against my own numbers on a rounding error.
 *
 * What the floor buys — the largest tap default, the smallest row pitch — is
 * DERIVED and printed, never typed here, so this comment cannot rot into a
 * number that stopped being true.

 * CIRCLES. The boss carries a different radius — I derived it by ratio on

 * THE ONE PAIR MY INVARIANT COULD NOT EXPRESS. A margin over a uniform pair, on
 * a screen with a non-uniform pair in it.
 *
 * The three pairs, and each is a fact about geometry the generator guarantees:
 *
 *   live       same floor, adjacent columns — `COL_X - 2 * NODE_R`. THE ONLY
 *              PAIR THAT CAN BOTH BE LIVE AT ONCE (every edge runs floor ->
 *              floor+1, so a reachable set is one floor). Sunna measured 987 live
 *              pairs across 2,601 decision moments and the closest was 54.23 px
 *              at 390 / 44.59 at 320 — which is this expression, to the hundredth.
 *   floor-node adjacent floors, two ordinary nodes — `ROW_H - 2 * NODE_R`.
 *              Never both live. Legibility only.
 *   floor-boss adjacent floors, the boss above the lone top shrine
 *              (`engine/mapgen.js` puts it there in every act) —
 *              `ROW_H - BOSS_R - NODE_R`. Never both live. RED TODAY.
 *
 * Every input is a parameter with the module's const as its default, so the
 * corpus can plant both faces of every pair — a red the fixtures cannot reach is
 * a check nobody has watched fail (the instrument rule).
 *
 * `why` names WHICH input made it unanswerable, because "the geometry is NaN" and
 * "the circles collide" are two different failures and a reader must not have to
