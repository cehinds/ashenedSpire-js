// src/model/consequence.js — DOES THIS CHOICE LEAVE A MARK THE RUN CANNOT TAKE
// BACK? One home for that question, and it is asked of the entry's own
// characteristics, never of a list of event ids.
//
// WHY IT IS NOT A LIST. The obvious build for "hold to confirm the dangerous
// ones" is a set of event ids somewhere in the UI. That set is wrong the day
// someone authors the twenty-first event: the new curse ships with no hold and
// nothing goes red, because a hand-kept list cannot know what it was not told.
// Law 0 clause 1 says the entry DESCRIBES and the machinery DERIVES, and this
// is that sentence applied to danger.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// IT FAILS CLOSED, AND THE FIRST DRAFT DID NOT. Viki's gate, and both halves of
// it were right:
//
//   (1) SIGN-BLINDNESS. `addCinders` was excluded categorically, but a spend is
//       `{ op: 'addCinders', amount: -50 }` and three shipped choices do exactly
//       that. Under this file's own axis they qualified, and the answer came
//       back "a tap is enough".
//   (2) THE CLOSURE WAS OVER THE WRONG SET, and this is the sharper one. The
//       claim was bounded by `RUN_OPCODES`. Event effect lists DEMONSTRABLY
//       LEAVE IT — `damage` and `heal` ship in events today — because
//       `executeRunEffects` runs the whole `OPCODES` vocabulary through a
//       player facade. Nothing bleeds yet; the argument was simply unsound. An
//       event that borrows a permanent combat op (`exhaust`) would be invisible
//       with nothing red.
//
// His verdict, and it is the fix in one line: THE ENUMERATION WAS LOAD-BEARING
// WHERE A DEFAULT SHOULD BE. So the enumeration flipped. There is no list of
// dangerous ops any more. There is a list of ops POSITIVELY KNOWN TO BE SAFE,
// and everything else — every op nobody has ruled on, every opcode added after
// this file was written, every typo — is binding. Being wrong now costs one
// held thumb and is visible on screen; before, it cost a curse and was silent.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// THE FALSIFIERS, both run by tools/holdconfirm.mjs:
//   --new-entry   author one fictional event with a curse, content only, ZERO
//                 code commits: it arrives holding.
//   --fail-closed a choice carrying an op this file has never heard of holds,
//                 and the run prints every declared opcode that would.
//
// WHOSE THIS IS. The *characteristic* — what makes a consequence heavy — was
// dispatched to VIKI. Viki may replace the body and keep the name; every caller
// reads these functions and nothing re-derives them.
