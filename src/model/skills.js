// the focus group, one for dual-wielding and one per class; every track
// climbs the same curve shape, so one simulator probe measures them all.
//
// THE TRACKS ARE DERIVED, NEVER LISTED: the weapon and focus tracks are the
// itemType nodes of the tree (content/source/nodes.csv), the armour tracks
// are the framework's weight classes (content/framework/mechanics.json), the
// class tracks are the class registry. Author a new item type or a class and
// its track exists; there is no second list to keep in step.
//
// THE NUMBERS ARE balance.skill's: base, growth and roundTo for the shape,
// the award sizes for the engine's hooks (engine/skillXp.js). Nothing here
// carries a number of its own.
