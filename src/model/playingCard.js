// src/model/playingCard.js — what a playing card IS, with no opinion about
// how it looks.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS THIS SHAPE. Equipment has had a model since
// its face was built: `src/model/equipmentCard.js` projects a piece into
// `{ id, name, type, facts, bonuses, tags, flavor, requirement, rarity }` and
// `renderEquipmentCard` draws that and nothing else. The playing card — the
// most-drawn object in the game, and the one on every surface the card series
// has been correcting — never got the same treatment. `renderCard` resolved
// the definition, the tag junction, the cost profile, the type presentation
// and the class tint INSIDE the function that writes innerHTML, so the answer
// to "what is this card" existed only as a side effect of drawing one.
//
// That is why five renderers could not share anything: there was nothing to
// share. A view can be swapped; a projection tangled into a view cannot.
//
// THE LINE THIS FILE HOLDS: the model says WHAT A CARD IS, the view says HOW
// IT READS. So the filled text template — which escapes, wraps changed numbers
// in `.val.up` / `.val.down`, and colours keywords — stays in the view where
// the other HTML lives; this file hands over the TOKENS that fill it and the
// base to compare against, which is the data half of that same job. The same
// line is why `accent`, `color` and `radius` appear here as VALUES and never
// as CSS: a number a designer authored is data; the property it is assigned to
// is presentation.
//
// PURE AND FROZEN, like every model beside it: no DOM, no callbacks, no live
// run object retained. Everything is read at call time and the result is deep
// frozen, so a renderer cannot quietly make the model its scratch space.

/**
 * playingCardModel(registries, ref, { preview }) → a frozen record.
 *
 * `ref` is `{ cardId, upgraded, instanceId? }` — the same shape `renderCard`
 * has always taken. `preview` is combat's live resolution when the card is in
 * a hand; without one the card reads its authored numbers.
 *
 * WHAT THE CALLER GETS, AND WHY EACH PIECE IS HERE RATHER THAN IN THE VIEW:
 *
 *   identity   id, instanceId, name, icon, rarity, classId, upgraded
 *              — what the card is. The instrument hooks (`data-card-id`,
 *              `data-instance-id`) are these, so they stop being re-derived.
 *
 *   type       id and label. The label used to be computed inline as
 *              `(ty && ty.label) || def.type.toUpperCase()`, which meant an
 *              authored type with no row silently changed case.
 *
 *   costs      action / mana / stamina / variable, from the framework profile
 *              or the preview's already-resolved numbers. One answer, so the
 *              face badge and the tooltip cost line cannot disagree — they
 *              computed it separately before.
 *
 *   tags       resolved through the ACTIVE registries, with the legacy-school
 *              duplicate filtered and the inheritance sources attached. This
 *              is the most tangled derivation in the old renderer and the one
 *              most worth having somewhere testable.
 *
 *   paint      authored colours and radii as values. See the line above.
 *
 *   tokens     what fills the text template, and `base` to compare against so
 *              a raised number can be marked as raised.
