/**
 * The tier granularity a `resource.attributeTier` row folds at.
 *
 * A ROW THAT DOES NOT STATE ONE INHERITS THE RULE IT FOLDS INTO — Law 0
 * clause 1: the entry describes ("+N HP per tier of CON"), the machinery
 * derives what a tier is. `pointsPerTier` stayed REQUIRED here until
 * 2026-08-17 and the one shipped row said 5, which is `derivedStatRules`'
 * own tier size written a second time; the copy was invisible until
 * Constantine asked for that size to be a dial ("let's make the increment of
 * 5 points for reasonable change be confurable as well"). At a 1-point tier
 * the host rule said 1, the relic still said 5, and the fold contract
 * REFUSED — correctly, since +1 per 5 CON cannot be added to a per-1 rule —
 * so a reaver could not start a run at all.
 *
 * STATING IT IS STILL LEGAL AND STILL MEANS WHAT IT SAID (Law 0 clause 3: an
 * override is data). It simply must then match the rule it folds into, which
 * is the contract that has always applied.
 *
 * `tierSizes` is the HOST's resolved granularity per resource, passed by the
 * caller that has it. Absent, the authored table is read — the same answer
 * every caller got before this parameter existed.
