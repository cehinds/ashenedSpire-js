// granted — and capacity must derive from the three (validateRunShape). v2
// saves lack the ledger and are attributed once at the load door
// (initializeRunFlaskCharges); v1 additionally predates starting kits.
// 7 (plan phase 3a): `zones` and `collection` ride the save. They are a
// PROJECTION of the fields that own the truth today — `class`, `loadout`,
// `relics`, `deck` — written at every door (createRunState, serializeRun,
// migrateRunSchema) by syncZones and shape-checked by validateRunShape. The
// legacy fields stay authoritative until phase 3b flips the readers and
// writers; until then a save whose zones disagree with its legacy fields is
// re-projected at the load door with a ledger note, never refused.
// 12 (SPEC §15.1): a pending reward may carry `levelCards` rows (keyed
// `levelCard:<n>`, picks in `chosenDraftCardIds`) and `cardMissed`. The bump
// is what makes an OLDER build refuse-and-keep such a save rather than read
// it and drop the rows; an 11 save has no level-card rows, so 11 → 12 is a
// no-op at the migration door.
// 13 (SPEC §15.3): `smithingStonesRefined`, the refined-stone purse, rides
// the save. A v12-or-older save is filled with 0 at migrateRunSchema, so an
// older build can never be the one to write the field away.
// 14 (SPEC §14.2): a shop stock carries its kind and the offerings its visit
// laid out (`shopStock.kind`, `shopStock.offerings`, and the same on an atlas
// shop point's persisted stock). A v13-or-older stock is read as `market`
// offering today's shelves, filled at migrateRunSchema with nothing rerolled.
// 15 (SPEC §14.3, §14.6 step 5a): `sigils` (owned, uninstalled sigil ids) and
// `sigilSlots` (the slots cut into items, keyed like itemMounts) ride the
// save, and a loadout may carry `boughtArmour`, the armour sets bought at a
// market. A v14-or-older save is filled with [] and {} at migrateRunSchema;
// `boughtArmour` is optional (absent means none bought).
// 16 (SPEC §14.3, §14.6 step 5b): `consumables` ({ [id]: count }, skill books
// and revive tokens) and `companions` ([{ id, combatsLeft }]) ride the save. A
// v15-or-older save is filled with {} and [] at migrateRunSchema.
// 17 (SPEC §14.4, §14.6 step 6): a `blacksmith` stock can sit on `shopStock`
// and on an atlas smith point's `serviceStates[pointId].stock` (rolled on
// first entry). The bump is what makes an OLDER build refuse-and-keep such a
// save rather than open a kind it has no screen for; a v16 save has no
// blacksmith stock, so 16 → 17 fills nothing at the migration door.
// 18 (SPEC §14.5, §14.6 step 7): `trainingPool`, the XP a wise master's
// respec refunded and redistribute spends, rides the save; and a `master`
// stock can sit on `shopStock` and on an atlas master point's
// `serviceStates[pointId].stock`, which an older build must refuse and keep.
// A v17-or-older save is filled with a pool of 0 at migrateRunSchema.
// 19 (SPEC §15.4, §15.5 step 5): `attunedSigils`, the legendary sigils the run
// holds attuned (a subset of `sigils`), rides the save. A v18-or-older save is
// filled with [] at migrateRunSchema and its `sigils` are left untouched.
