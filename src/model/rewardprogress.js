// src/model/rewardprogress.js — WHAT THE FIGHT MOVED, on the spoils door.
//
// Constantine, 2026-09-20, on the victory door: "why don't I see level
// progression, xp gained, skill progression in here either". He was right to
// ask: the fight banks character XP (model/levelup.js) and pays every skill
// track it touched (engine/skillXp.js) at `onCombatEnd`, BEFORE the door
// opens — so the ledgers the player is being rewarded on had already moved
// and the screen said nothing about it. The spoils read like the whole payout
// while being only the half you pick up.
//
// This is that missing half, derived from the current ledgers:
// the screen draws rows and decides nothing. A row is a track's ledger as it
// stands NOW (skill levels are paid; the character level awaits a click) plus the XP this fight paid
// into it — the gain is a receipt the caller hands in (main.js keeps it on
// the pending-reward offer, so a reload resumes the same sentence), never a
// re-derivation from the combat log this file cannot see.
//
// WHICH TRACKS. The character level always, then every active skill track,
// the ones this fight paid first and the highest-levelled after.
// A track nothing has ever touched and this fight did not pay is not a row:
// the door would otherwise list every weapon group in the game.
//
// FAIL SOFT, and this is the one place in the model where that is right: the
// panel is INFORMATIONAL, and it is mounted by preview scenes and old callers
// whose run has no class, no ledgers and whose registries may carry no curve.
// A missing table costs the player a bar, never the spoils behind it — so
// every lookup here is guarded and an unreadable track is simply not a row.
// NOT A ROW MEANS NOT A ROW: a track whose curve will not read is dropped
// rather than carried with an empty `xpToNext`, because the only thing a row
// with no next level can say is "Max" — and a broken table reading as a
// player's ceiling is a lie, not a degradation (Copilot, #1232).
