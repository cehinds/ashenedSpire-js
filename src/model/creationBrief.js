// src/model/creationBrief.js — D26's SHORT FORM, as one read model.
//
// Constantine, 2026-08-15: "the statte descriptions kind of suck. perhaps have
// a simplifed verison with just the starting stats, starting armaments
// selection , and then have the ability to expand by clicking, with tool tips.
// for character creation I mean"
//
// THE FIX IS LAYERED PROSE, NOT A SECOND SET OF PROSE. Every entry here has a
// FACE (name, the first authored sentence constrained to one line, and value)
// and a REVEAL (the full sentence plus derived benefits, one tap down). The
// vocabulary and the tier field are model/disclosure.js; this file is the one
// place that composes them, so the creation screen and the F1 combat frame
// cannot answer "what does a stat look like" two different ways.
//
// WHAT IS AUTHORED AND WHAT IS DERIVED (Law 0 clause 1 — an entry DESCRIBES,
// the machinery DERIVES). Authored, once, per row: `sense`, one sentence with
// NO NUMBER IN IT. Derived here, every render, from the tables that own the
// facts:
//
//   an attribute's FEEDS      every derived stat whose sourceStat is this
//                             attribute, with its own gain and its own tier
//                             size — so adding a rule row changes the
//                             attribute's reveal with nobody editing prose
//   an attribute's UNLOCKS    every armament that names it in
//                             equipmentRequirements, with the minimum it asks
//                             — which is how STRENGTH has an honest reveal on
//                             a screen where it feeds no pool at all
//   a derived stat's SOURCE   its own rule row, in words
//   a derived stat's RECEIPT  statProjection's formula string, unchanged: the
//                             arithmetic already has one home and this is not
//                             a second one
//   an armament's EFFECTS     its `mods` column read through modFields, the
//                             same vocabulary the Armoury comparison reads
//   an armament's REQUIREMENTS equipmentRequirementReceipt, met or unmet
//
// AN ENTRY THAT FEEDS NOTHING AND UNLOCKS NOTHING SAYS SO. Silence there would
// be the screen implying a stat matters because it is drawn; the derivation
// prints "Nothing reads it yet" and that sentence goes stale the moment the
// tables change, which is the point.
//
// THE RELIC IS HERE BECAUSE THE SCREEN NEVER NAMED IT (Bjorn, 2026-08-15): the
// class-pick panel itemized "Items 6 + relics 0 = 6" one row below a screen
// that never mentioned the starting relic — and D23 made that relic the carrier
// of the class's own numbers. Its passive modifiers are derived below; its
// authored sentence is composed by the caller through the shared relicText
// renderer (`extras`), because token-filling is a rendering concern with one
// home already (ui/components/card.js) and this module keeps no copy of it.
//
// REMOVAL CONDITION (SOP 1's corollary): deleted the day the creation screen
// and the combat frame no longer show stats — the split has no subject then.
