// src/model/mapknowledge.js — HOW MUCH THE PLAYER KNOWS ABOUT A MAP NODE,
// derived, on one ladder, for every map mode.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, and it is Viki's collapse rather than my feature.
// Constantine asked for fog of war. The obvious build is a fourth flag on the
// map screen beside the three it already had, and that build is wrong:
//
//   n.type vs shownType   an `event` node draws `?` — "there is a place here,
//                         I do not know what kind"
//   `revealed`            the Sealstone Key resolves that `?` into its real kind
//   `visited` / `current` where the player has already stood
//
// Three spellings of ONE question — *how much do you know about this node* — and
// fog is a fourth spelling of the same question, not a new subject. So the flag
// does not get built. The question gets a ladder:
//
//   hidden   you do not know the place is there. NOTHING is drawn.
//   placed   you know a place is there, not what it is. The `?` mark.
//   known    you know what it is. Its own icon.
//
// WHAT THAT BUYS, and it is the test of whether the collapse was real: the
// Sealstone Key STOPS BEING A SPECIAL CASE. It is no longer "a relic the map
// screen checks for"; it is the one operator that lifts a node from `placed` to
// `known`, and it reads identically in both map modes because it always answered
// a different question from fog. Viki measured the trap before I built it:
//
//   `revealUnknown` answers WHAT KIND OF PLACE IS THAT about a node already
//   drawn. Fog answers IS IT DRAWN AT ALL. Two axes, not one lever.
//
// So fog moves a node between `hidden` and the rest; the relic moves it between
// `placed` and `known`; and neither knows the other exists. The cost is real and
// is a BALANCE finding, not a defect: over 300 seeds the relic goes from 7.56
// actionable nodes to 1.30 under fog (Viki). Fog starves it. That number is
// handed to the checking and player-experience seats, not answered here — see
// the note on `revealUnknown` below.
//
// NOT THE COMPENDIUM'S LADDER, deliberately. The compendium has a reveal ladder
// that is rung-for-rung the same shape over a different subject (what the
// PROFILE has met, across runs, forever) and Viki's ruling is that nothing
// between them must ever agree: a shared home would tie an act's fog to a
// player's lifetime bestiary the first time either grew a rung. Same Pattern,
// two homes, on purpose. Do not merge them.
//
// PURE AND HEADLESS on purpose — no document, no settings object beyond the one
// it is handed — so `tools/mapfog.mjs --selftest` can turn it red without a
// browser, and so the map screen and that instrument cannot disagree about what
// the player was shown.

 * The two map modes. `fog` IS THE GAME NOW — Constantine, 2026-08-08: "ok, the

 *
 * WHAT THIS TOKEN USED TO SAY, AND WHY IT WAS WRONG IN EXACTLY ONE WAY. It said
 * `path`, and the reasoning under it was Sunna's and mine and it was sound:
 * NOBODY'S FIRST RUN IS THE EXPERIMENT, and an A/B needs a control. It is also
 * precisely how he came to open a build, see every node, and be told the fog was
 * done. A default is not a neutral position — it is the only reading most runs
 * will ever get, and we shipped the one he had asked us to replace.
 *
 * SO ONE THING MOVED AND THE REST STANDS. His word closes the DEFAULT. It does
 * not close Ruling 1: `path` stays a real, reachable value of the setting and
 * must keep working byte-for-byte, because the comparison is still the thing he
 * is judging — it is now reached by choosing it rather than by doing nothing.
 *
 * THE COMPARISON IS STILL THE DELIVERABLE. The toggle lives in Settings →
 * Display rather than in Custom Climb — Marina's ruling, on the argument that
 * Settings is the only surface reachable WHILE YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE THING YOU
 * ARE JUDGING. Custom Climb gets nothing new: fog cannot be A/B'd mid-run,
 * because once you have seen the map you cannot unsee it, so the A/B is its
 * existing seed field plus this toggle.

 * ONE COMPUTATION, TWO ASKS, and that is why it lives in this file rather than

 *
 *   "strines should unfog the next nearest shine node"
 *   "as new paths open, the path to the nearest shrine should have a glowing
 *    effect"
 *
 * Both are the same question — *which shrine is nearest, walking forward from
 * here, and what is the walk* — asked from two different `from`s. The unfog
 * asks it from every shrine the player has STOOD ON; the glow asks it from
 * where the player is standing NOW. Two answers, one function: a second
 * traversal would be the second copy that lets the lit shrine and the glowing
 * lane disagree about which shrine is next.
 *
 * (The third ask of that message — levelling at a shrine — shares the SUBJECT
 * and shares nothing else. It is `model/levelup.js`, and it needs no graph.)
 *
 * FORWARD ONLY. `next` is a one-way edge and the climb is one-way, so this is
 * a plain BFS with no back-edges: a shrine you have already climbed past is
 * not a shrine you can reach.
 *
 * THE SOURCE IS NEVER THE ANSWER. Standing on a shrine, the nearest shrine is
 * the NEXT one — which is what both asks mean and is why there is no
 * `includeSource` option to get wrong.
 *
 * DETERMINISTIC AT EVERY TIE, and it is a property this file's instrument
 * asserts rather than a habit. Two shrines at equal distance are settled by
 * the smaller node id, and every frontier is walked in sorted order, so the
 * answer does not depend on object key order or on which walker laid the edge
 * down first. A glow that picks a different lane on a re-mount is a glow the
 * player cannot follow.
 *
 * `from` may be one id or an array of them — the array is what the entrance
 * needs, where the player is standing on nothing and every door is a source.

 * undiscovered map behaves.
 *
 * THIS HEADING USED TO SAY "HE PICKED — Constantine, 2026-08-08", AND THAT WAS
 * FALSE. Asked straight on 2026-08-13 he answered "idk about hte forks part" —
 * an honest idk, not an answer, of record in commons/decisions/directions.md
 * D19 (claude-family). The attribution is stripped on his own word: what ships
 * below is the family's default, not his ruling, and the question returns to
 * him later as two pictures — the door that has answered better than any
 * sentence.
 *
 * WHAT USED TO BE HERE was `FOG_KEEP_FORKS`, one boolean holding both readings
 * of his sentence with both answers photographed, and a `mapFogForks` shot flag
 * to reach the other one. Both were deleted under the false record above. The
 * DELETION stands anyway: a shipped game carries one default, and resurrecting
 * the toggle would be the third state the original deletion refused — an
 * option nobody chose, kept warm. This paragraph is the receipt.
 *
 * THE UNSHIPPED READING IS NOT LOST, IT IS DEMOTED. It lives on in
 * `tools/mapfog.mjs` as a MUTANT — "the trail, but the roads not taken re-fog" —
 * where it used to be a legal cell of the sweep. That is the right home for a
 * reading we deliberately do not ship: something the instrument must catch, not
 * something the game can be talked into. If he ever picks it, that is a design
 * change with a row in this file's history, not a revert.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES THE PROMISE BELOW TRUE, and it is structure rather than a value:
 * `run.path` only grows, and `litNodes` shines every node in it, so the lit set
 * is monotone BY CONSTRUCTION. `--selftest` asserts that unconditionally now
 * (it used to assert it only on the `+forks` half of the corpus), so the

 *                    default (ours, not his ruling; D19 note above), so the
 *                    known ground widens into a cone behind the frontier

 *   the doors        every entrance, for the whole act. Before the first move
 *                    they ARE the split.

 *                    the end node." The shrine below it is not a landmark and
 *                    stays fogged until it is reached — the boss is what the
 *                    climb is aimed at; the shrine is a stop on the way.
 *   the next shrine  "strines should unfog the next nearest shine node"
 *                    (Constantine, 2026-08-16). For every shrine the player has
 *                    STOOD ON, the nearest shrine ahead of it (nearestShrine
 *                    above). The NODE, not the walk to it — his sentence names
 *                    a node, and lighting the walk would hand over the shape of
 *                    an act nobody has climbed.
 *
 * ARRIVAL, NOT THE REST BUTTON, and the difference is named rather than
 * discovered. This fires when the player REACHES a shrine, because reaching one
 * is what `run.path` records; "did they press Rest" is not in the run at all,
 * and adding a `run.rested` to carry it would be the second copy of the trail
 * that the paragraph below refuses. A player who walks into a shrine and smiths
 * instead of resting has still seen the shrine, and the light says so.
 *
 * NOTHING IS STORED, and the stickiness is why that is worth saying twice. A
 * cumulative reveal is the obvious candidate for a `run.seen` array, and a
 * `run.seen` would be a SECOND COPY OF THE TRAIL — the day it disagreed with
 * `run.path` the map would lie about where the player had been, and it would
 * need a migration for every save written before it existed. Instead the whole
 * history is replayed from `run.path`, which already persists: fog survives a
 * save/load with no new field, no migration, and nothing to drift.
