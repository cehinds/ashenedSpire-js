// src/model/floorplan.js — what a floor rule MEANS in an act of a given length.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Constantine: "make this configurable by data driven
// tooling." The blocker was that the map's knobs were absolute floor indices:
//
//     fixed: { 1: 'monster', 9: 'treasure', 15: 'shrine' }
//     noEliteOrShrineBefore: 6
//     noShrineOn: 14
//
// Every one of those numbers means something different when `floors` changes,
// and nothing said so. Measured (Freja, 24 seeds):
//
//   - `9: 'treasure'` is a CLIFF. Shorten the act below 10 floors and floor 9
//     does not exist, so the treasure rank is deleted — 4.0 treasure nodes per
//     act becomes 0.0, across 24/24 seeds, silently.
//   - `15: 'shrine'` HAS NEVER FIRED at any shipped act length. Deleting it
//     changes 0 of 24 seeds at 10, 12 and 15 floors, because the top floor is
//     typed by the generator before the rules run and is therefore not rollable.
//     A rule that has never fired, sitting in the table looking load-bearing.
//   - `noEliteOrShrineBefore: 6` gates 36% of a 15-floor act and 56% of a
//     10-floor one. Same 6, different game.
//
// That is SOP 2's drift clause applied to data: a constant whose MEANING moves
// while the constant does not. So the fix is not a longer table of magic
// numbers — it is ANCHORS. A rule names a POSITION, and the position resolves
// against the act it is in.
//
// AND THE RESOLUTION IS A READOUT, not just an internal step (Marina's ruling on
// Constantine's reading 2): `describePlan()` prints "fixed treasure -> floor 9
// of 14 rollable (fraction 0.64)". A knob you can turn and a number you can read
// are the same feature; a knob without the readout is the thing that shipped.
//
// LAYERING: this is model/, imports nothing from engine/, and owns NODE_TYPES —
// which mapgen.js used to export and nothing outside it consumed.
// (`ui/uiContent.js` holds its own node-type map for icons and blurbs. That is a
// second copy of the closed set and it is NOT swept here; named, not fixed.)
