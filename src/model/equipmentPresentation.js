// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT A SWAP WOULD COST — read from the price, never re-derived (Viki, MR-41)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// ---- WHY THIS ROW IS KEPT AT ALL, AND WHEN THAT REASON DIES (Saga, MR-45) ---
//
// A8 IS THE PRESENTATION HALF OF HIS SWAP-COST ASK. Constantine, D15,
// 2026-08-08: *"switching sets should cost actions. PERHAPS THIS ACTION COSTS
// MORE OR LESS DEPENDING ON TALISMAN or starting relic… let's default to
// costing 2 actions… THAT WAY I CAN TRY EACH."*
//
// KEEP IT, AND THIS IS THE REASON THAT HOLDS: THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE A PLAYER
// MEETS THE PRICE. Settings › Advanced ships the RULE — the row keyed
// `swapCostRule`, labelled *"Weapon swap cost"*, in the settings table at
// `src/ui/screens/settings.js` — so A8 is not invisible, and the reason first
// written here, *"THE ONLY TRACE OF A8 ON A SCREEN"*, was overstated. But what
// Settings shows is a WORD: which of his three prices is in force, never what
// it costs. No shipped screen states the NUMBER of Actions a swap charges.
// `src/engine/combat.js` charges it and emits `armamentSwapped` carrying
// `cost`, and NO SCREEN SUBSCRIBES: the event lands in `combat.eventLog`,
// whose only reader under `src/ui` filters for `relicTriggered`, and the one
// consumer of the payload anywhere is engine test `28p`. He asked to TRY EACH,
// which is a comparison, and this row is the only place it is drawn.
//
//   DISCHARGE CONDITION: this reason dies the day any OTHER shipped screen puts
//   a swap price, as a number, in front of a player — a combat affordance, an
//   `armamentSwapped` reader, a Settings row that prints Actions instead of a
//   rule name. On that day this row is ordinary code, judged on its own merits
//   and deletable like any other. Measured undischarged at `dabd7d9`.
//
//   DO NOT KEEP IT BECAUSE IT IS THE LAST TRACE OF A REQUEST HE MADE. That was
//   the reason first recorded here and IT IS FALSE. The ask has other traces
//   and several are executable: the `flat`/`gear`/`category` rows of
//   `balance.equipment.swapCostRules` in `src/content/balance.js`, under a
//   paragraph quoting his sentence verbatim; `swapCostFor()`'s
//   gearOn/gearDelta/gearIgnored rungs in `src/model/loadout.js`; and engine
//   tests `28p`, `28q`, `28r` in `tests/engine.test.js`. ONE GREP DISCHARGES A
//   LAST-TRACE CLAIM, and the reader careful enough to run that grep is handed
//   an argument for the deletion this comment exists to prevent. A false reason
//   for a right keep is an invitation.
//
//   NO COUNT OF THOSE TRACES IS WRITTEN HERE, DELIBERATELY. The first version
//   of this marker printed one — *"at least five traces and four executable"*
//   — and it was wrong in the arithmetic and in two of the names it counted:
//   `content/balance.js` does not exist (it is `src/content/balance.js`), and
//   `engine test 28c` has never existed in this repo at all, while `28b` is
//   about which hand holds a piece. A number in a marker goes stale, and a
//   stale number is an argument for the deletion the marker exists to prevent
//   — which is the exact failure this paragraph already records against the
//   reason it replaced. Falsified by Sten; citations corrected by Bjorn; both
//   2026-08-15.
//
//   AND IT DOES RENDER, which the first version of this marker denied. Under
//   the shipped default (`flat`) a weapon swap costs the same either way and
//   the row correctly stays silent — but Settings › Advanced switches the rule
//   to `category` with no content and no code, and a heavy-weapon candidate
//   then reads 2 → 3. That is asserted, not asserted-about — the row named
//   "the live rule decides the row" in
//   `node tools/equipment-surface-receipts.mjs` measures it. So the keep does
//   not rest on a surface nobody can reach.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS REPLACES, MEASURED RATHER THAN ARGUED. This row used to be
// `beforeMods.swapCostDelta → afterMods.swapCostDelta` under the label
// *"Active-set swap Actions"* — a DELTA wearing a PRICE's name, and a second
// home for a fact `swapCostFor()` already owns. With one talisman authored
// (`self.swapCost=+2`, a CSV row and no code) it renders **0 → 2** while the
// engine charges:
//
//   flat (the shipped default)  2 → 2, and the +2 DISCARDED (gearIgnored 2)
//   gear                        2 → 4
//   category                    2 → 2, and the +2 DISCARDED (gearIgnored 2)
//
// Wrong under all three, and loudest under the default. The trigger is a
// content author adding a row and touching no code — the exact act Law 0 exists
// to make easy — so it is a mine under the content pipeline, not a cosmetic
// slip. `swapCostFor()` is the ONE place that knows the base, the rule, the
// category and the two gear channels; this reads its answer and does no
// arithmetic of its own. That is the whole fix: one fact, one home.
//
// SAME SET, BEFORE AND AFTER. Each combat-swappable slot is priced at the SAME
// set index in both loadouts — the candidate's own set for its own slot, the
// active set for the others — so the two numbers differ by this piece and
// nothing else. Pricing "your current set" against "the candidate's set" would
// fold a set change into a piece comparison and the row could move for a reason
// the player did not choose.
//
// WHY ONLY `swap === 'combat'` SLOTS. There is no mid-fight price for a slot
// you cannot change mid-fight. A talisman or an outfit still shows up here —
// it is WORN, so it moves the hands' price — and the row names the hand rather
// than implying you pay to change the charm.
//
// `gearIgnored` IS CONSULTED, WHICH IS THE POINT. A gear-off rule declines the
// talisman/relic delta; `swapCostFor` returns the declined amount precisely so
// "a talisman doing nothing says so instead of looking broken" (its own header).
// The row renders when the PRICE moves or when the DECLINED amount moves, so
// under `flat` the charm reads `2 → 2` with a sentence saying the rule refused
// its +2. Silence there would be the same defect one step quieter.
//
// ---- THE RELIC CHANNEL HAS NO SURFACE HERE, AND THAT IS ARM 2 (MR-46) -------
//
// `relicDelta` below is real and it CANCELS: a relic does not change when you
// slot a weapon, so it lands identically in `before` and `after` and a
// before/after comparison can never show it. That is correct for this row and
// it is NOT a gap this row can close. The starting-relic half of A8 —
// Constantine's *"depending on Talisman OR STARTING RELIC"* — therefore has no
// presentation anywhere in the tree: a relic authoring `swapCostDelta` today
// changes the price a player pays and NOTHING on any screen moves. It does not
// lie; it says nothing, which is the harder failure.
//
// MARKER, and it is a claim, so it is checked (MR-45 — a structural decision
// leaves a TRUE marker with its reason and its discharge condition):
//   · reason        — a relic's delta cancels in a before/after comparison
//   · discharge     — the day any shipped presentation reader's output moves
//                     when a `swapCostDelta` relic is worn, this paragraph is
//                     false and must go
//   · the wake      — `node tools/swap-cost-relic-surface.mjs` goes RED when a
//                     relic authors `swapCostDelta` while no reader moves, and
//                     RED the other way when a reader moves while this marker
//                     still says none does.
//

// in the row's label last night, and the note below needs the same word — so
