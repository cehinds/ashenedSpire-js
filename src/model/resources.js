// src/model/resources.js — the engine half of the HUD resource bars.
//
// Constantine, 2026-08-08: "the stamina and mana bars should be under the
// health bar and the size of that bar should scale depending on the max total.
// much like elden ring's hud".
//
// THE SHAPE, and it is Law 0's: a resource bar is a ROW (src/content/resources.js)
// plus a READER (the closed set below). The renderer (ui/components/resbars.js)
// knows nothing about health, poise, stamina or mana — it draws whatever the
// rows say, in the order the rows say, at the length the max says. Adding a bar
// for a resource the model ALREADY exposes is one row and zero UI code; that is
// this feature's falsifier and tools/hudbars.mjs runs it.
//
// Stamina and Mana enter here only as readers of persisted derived pools. Their
// formulas remain in the versioned rules table; this module owns HUD projection,
// not gameplay authority. An unknown source is refused at boot rather than
// drawing a lying 0/0 trough.

/**
 * THE TRANSPOSE SCALE — one function, one edit.
 *
 * His word is "transpose scale" and it has not been ruled on. Every scale looks
 * identical at a single value and diverges everywhere else (Law 0 clause 5: the
 * plausible-but-wrong derivation is the invisible one), so this is drawn LINEAR
 * and flagged as linear rather than guessed at.
 *
 * If he answers "curved", EXACTLY ONE LINE CHANGES — the return below. The two
 * candidates, with what they do to the bars actually on screen today (track
 * 264 px at 390 wide, health domain 84):
 *
 *   linear   x            72 -> 226 px   78 -> 245 px   84 -> 264 px
 *   sqrt     Math.sqrt(x) 72 -> 244 px   78 -> 254 px   84 -> 264 px
 *   log      Math.log1p(x) 72 -> 258 px  78 -> 261 px   84 -> 264 px
 *
 * A curve COMPRESSES the low end upward: it makes a weak character's bar look
 * nearly as long as a strong one's, which is the opposite of what "the size
 * scales depending on the max" is for on a 14 %-spread domain. Over a WIDE
 * domain (enemy poise, 4..36) a curve is the better read: linear puts a 4-poise
 * mob at 11 % and a curve puts it at 33 %, above the floor instead of on it.
 * Both numbers are measured, not asserted — tools/hudbars.mjs --scales prints
 * this table from this function.

/**
 * THE CLOSED SET OF SOURCES — the whole vocabulary a row may name.
 *
 * `read(view, entity)` returns { cur, max } or NULL. Null is the refusal and it
 * is load-bearing: an entity with no poiseMeter — a zero-threshold player
 * (createPlayerCombatEntity stamps NO meter at threshold 0), a legacy headless
 * fixture — reads null and the bar is ABSENT, not empty. The player carries a
 * REAL-BUT-EMPTY meter since 2026-08-14: max is the equipment stagger-threshold
 * receipt (stamped by engine/combat.js from statProjection's
 * playerPoiseThresholdReceipt — D10.4's skinny bar, D17 q5's "should also
 * effect player too"), value is 0 with NO writer until the player-poise
 * mechanics are dealt. tools/hudbars.mjs A11 asserts both halves: the vessel
 * present and empty at a real threshold, and ABSENT — not an empty trough —
 * at threshold 0.
 *
 * `domain(pop)` derives the largest max this resource reaches, over the
 * population the surface can display — DERIVED from content, never typed, so it
 * cannot drift when content is added (Law 0 clause 1). A row may override with
 * an explicit `domainMax` (Law 0 clause 3: an override is data).
 *
 * ADDING A SOURCE IS AN ENGINE CHANGE — one entry here, in one act with its
 * schema and validator (Law 0 clause 2). We say that plainly rather than
 * promising stamina is "just a row": it is one reader plus one row, and the
 * half that is genuinely free is the UI.

 *     `--plate-reserve-*`, and the reason it exists is measured there). The
 *     label prints `cur/max`, so the widest it can ever be is set by the
 *     largest max the CONTENT can produce — 96, not 500.
 *
 * MEASURED, because collapsing them is not a style question: while the reserve
 * read the reference, HP reserved three digits for a number that tops out at
 * two and every pool reserved two for a number that tops out at one. At
 * 320x640 that ate the banded pool cells down to 5.81 px and the MP and SP
 * plates CLIPPED THEIR OWN LABELS ("◆ 2/2") at all eight swept maxima —
 * tools/hudbars.mjs A4, sixteen findings, green on dev the same hour.
 *

 *                render different px per point, and comparing bar lengths
 *                across resources reads nothing. The shared-rate alternative
 *                (Elden Ring's literal read) is dead by his word;
