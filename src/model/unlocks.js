// a later content edit can't take something back off a player.
//
// Headless and pure: no document, no storage, no timers.

// ---- WHAT A THING LOOKS LIKE BEFORE IT IS YOURS -----------------------------
//
// `reveal` is a CLOSED SET OF THREE and until now only two behaviours existed:
// 'hidden' dropped out, 'teased' and 'listed' were drawn identically. The
// distinction unlocks.csv documents in its own header — *teased = silhouette,
// listed = shown greyed with the hint* — had no screen that drew it, because the
// screen it was written for did not exist. The Compendium is that screen
// (Constantine: *"the potential weapons to unlock should be in its own menu on
// the main menu that keeps most things hidden"*), and the words were already in
// the table.
//
// ONE DECIDER, and that is why it is here rather than in either screen. Two
// things ask this question — `unlockView` below and the Compendium — and each
// used to carry its own copy of "'hidden' means absent". Two copies of one rule
// in two files with nothing checking they agree is the defect this house has
// spent two days killing; the Compendium would have been the third copy.
//
// AND `unlockView` HAS NO CALLERS IN src/ — measured at 77a02b9, e79e1cd and
// 52e0bc1. It is a dead truth function, and by my own rule that is not clutter,
// it is half of a fact whose other half is somewhere worse. Its living copy was
// `gate()` in equipment.js, which #90 deleted; nothing replaced it for armour.
// Routing it through revealState is still right — one home is one home whether
// or not anyone is home — but nobody should read "two callers" as coverage.
//
// `earned` is the caller's word for "this is already yours", whatever earning
// means for that kind of thing — an unlock condition met, or a piece found.
//
// ---- TWO AXES, AND THIS FILE OWNS EXACTLY ONE OF THEM (Viki, #90 sibling) ----
//
// This branch was authored at 77a02b9 and #90 landed under it. As written,
// `pieceReveal` answered TWO questions from one ladder of ifs: *is this piece
// yours* and *how much of what is not yours may be shown*. The first now has a
// home — `ownership()` in model/loadout.js — and re-deriving it here made a
// SECOND DEFINITION OF WHAT YOU OWN, in different words (`piece.kind !== 'armor'`
// against `fromDropPool`, a caller-built `available` against the model's `found`).
// Not a copy written twice by one hand: a copy written once on each side of a
// merge, which is the direction nothing was watching.
//
// ASK WHAT THE PREDICATE'S SUBJECT IS. Possession's subject is the PROFILE —
// what does this save hold. Disclosure's subject is the CATALOGUE ROW — how much
// of this entry may someone who does not hold it see. Different subject, two
// axes, two homes; the same test that kept fog and `revealUnknown` apart on the
// map. They meet in ONE join, below, which owns no condition of its own.
//
// The divergence was already representable, not hypothetical: `ownership()`
// honours `balance.equipment.persistence`, and this file's `available` set did
// not. At `persistence: 'perRun'` the model says you own nothing off-run and the
// old Compendium said you own your whole found list. One balance value apart.
//
// AND FREJA MEASURED THE SIZE OF IT, which I had only called live: on a profile
// holding everything, at `perRun`, THE MODEL SAYS 0 OF 24 HELD WHERE THE OLD
// SCREEN DREW 24. Her words: *the conflict he named is total, not marginal.*
// Not a rounding difference between two definitions — the whole screen.
//
// The other half of her measurement is why this shape and not a boolean: the
// new `has()` against dev's ladder is **2052 comparisons, 0 disagreements** —
// the split is ADDITIVE and no existing caller's answer moves. And a boolean
// alone is not enough, by her own screen's need: the cell picks
// `LOCK_COPY[gate]`, so a bare yes/no forces it to re-derive the route, which
// is this defect renamed. `why()` is what the caller actually consumes.
