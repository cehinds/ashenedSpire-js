// ---- ONE DRIVER FOR STARTING STATS (owner, 2026-09-20) ---------------------
//
// He had four dials for one idea: a "starting stat pool" per creation mode
// (three near-identical rows, two of them for modes no player can pick), a
// per-class attribute table in a separate tab, "Stat points per tier" filed
// under Assign points, and "Level-up value" under Progression. In his words:
// "changing class defaults and starting stats seem to be in multiple menus
// instead of having just one driver."
//
// So the pool is now A HANDFUL OF NUMBERS IN HIS WORDS, on the mode creation
// actually offers. The keys are unchanged (`…<modeId>.total`), but the row's
// FLOOR is not: it moved from the attribute count to the kit floor, so an older
// export carrying a smaller total is clamped to that floor with a named notice
// — see `raisedFloor` below and `parseAdvancedConfigFile`. The rest of the file
// still imports; before that, one stale total refused every other setting in it.
//
// ---- THE REFRAME (owner, 2026-09-20, second pass) --------------------------
//
// "I'd like the default stats to be low, with everyone having a total pool of
// points starting off. the default stat for each stat is 1 and assign allows a
// user to assign 3 points … Also, I'd like to have more stat customization
// options in general to be able to make this change in the settings."
//
// The shipped default is now the `lean` mode (content/attributes.js) and the
// topic is stated the way he states it — THE BASELINE IS THE FIRST NUMBER,
// because it is the one he named first and the one he wanted to type:
//
//   Starting value for every attribute   `…<modeId>.baseline`       (new)
//   Points available to assign           `…<modeId>.bonusPool`
//   Total points on a character          `…<modeId>.total`
//   Lowest a stat may be set to          `…<modeId>.minimum`        (new)
//   Highest a stat may be set to         `…<modeId>.maximum`        (new)
//   Points may be taken back off a stat  `…<modeId>.belowBaseline`  (new)
//
// BASELINE AND TOTAL ARE THE SAME FACT SAID TWO WAYS, so one of them has to
// win or the pair is a coin toss. The baseline wins WHEN IT IS SET: total is
// then `baseline × attributes + points available`, which is the arithmetic in
// his sentence. With no baseline typed, the total drives and the baseline is
// derived from it exactly as it always was — every configuration exported
// before this reframe therefore resolves to the same numbers it always did.
//
// EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS BELONG TO THIS TOPIC TOO, and that is why they are in
// this file rather than a new one. They are already the FLOOR under every dial
// here (`kitAttributeMinimums`): the total cannot go below what the starting
// kits ask for, so a stat scale and the numbers gating equipment are one
// question. `equipmentRequirementRows` puts each authored minimum on screen
// beside the scale that has to clear it, plus one multiplier for the whole
// table — his "across the board".
